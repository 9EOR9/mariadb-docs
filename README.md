  See how tabbed navigation and other GitBook features work. This is also a
  demonstration how the documentation structure can be (slightly) simplified.
---

# Pages to Look at

* The document categorizes various SQL statements and utilities into chapters and paths for easier navigation.
* Different content chunks may vary based on the server version.
* An example illustrates the complexity of capturing version-specific information in technical documentation.
* A link is provided to a Knowledge Base page for further comparison.
* An attempt is made at simplifying chapter naming conventions.

This is just a test to see if the GitBook-to-Slack bridge works as expected.
