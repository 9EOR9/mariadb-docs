# Percona XtraBackup

Percona XtraBackup is **not supported** in MariaDB. [Mariabackup](../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/mariabackup-sst-method.md) is the recommended backup method to use instead of Percona XtraBackup. See [Percona XtraBackup Overview: Compatibility with MariaDB](percona-xtrabackup-overview.md#compatibility-with-mariadb) for more information.

Open source tool for performing hot backups of MariaDB, MySQL and Percona Server databases.
