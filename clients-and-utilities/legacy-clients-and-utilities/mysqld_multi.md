# mysqld_multi

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadbd-multi`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqld_multi` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadbd-multi](../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-multi.md) for details.
