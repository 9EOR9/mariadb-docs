# mysqlreport

`mysqlreport` makes a friendly report of important MariaDB status values.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-report`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlreport` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-report](../mariadb-report.md) for details.
