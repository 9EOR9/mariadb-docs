# Server Response Packets (Binary Protocol)

The following response packets will be sent from the server to client in binary protocol only. They may be mixed with packets from the text protocol, like [OK_PACKET](../../4-server-response-packets/ok_packet.md), PACKET_METADATA or [ERR_PACKET](../../4-server-response-packets/err_packet.md).
