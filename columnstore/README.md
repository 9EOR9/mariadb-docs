# MariaDB ColumnStore

MariaDB ColumnStore is a columnar storage engine that utilizes a massively parallel distributed data architecture. It's a columnar storage system built by porting InfiniDB 4.6.7 to MariaDB, and released under the GPL license.

From [MariaDB 10.5.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1054-release-notes), it is available as a storage engine for MariaDB Server. Before then, it is only available as a separate download.

MariaDB ColumnStore is designed for big data scaling to process petabytes of data, linear scalability and exceptional performance with real-time response to analytical queries. It leverages the I/O benefits of columnar storage, compression, just-in-time projection, and horizontal and vertical partitioning to deliver tremendous performance when analyzing large data sets.
