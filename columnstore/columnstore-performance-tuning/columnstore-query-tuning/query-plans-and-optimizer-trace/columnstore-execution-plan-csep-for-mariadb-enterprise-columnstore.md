# ColumnStore Execution Plan (CSEP) for MariaDB Enterprise ColumnStore


# Overview


The ColumnStore storage engine uses a ColumnStore Execution Plan (CSEP) to represent a query plan internally.


When the select handler receives the `SELECT_LEX` object, it transforms it into a CSEP as part of the query planning and optimization process. For additional information, see "[MariaDB Enterprise ColumnStore Query Evaluation](../../../columnstore-architecture/mariadb-enterprise-columnstore-query-evaluation.md)."


# Viewing the CSEP


The CSEP for a given query can be viewed by performing the following:


1. Calling the `calSetTrace(1)` function:


```
SELECT calSetTrace(1);
```

2. Executing the query:


```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM columnstore_tab
WHERE column1 > '2020-04-01'
AND column1 < '2020-11-01';
```

3. Calling the `calGetTrace()` function:


```
SELECT calGetTrace();
```
