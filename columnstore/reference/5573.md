# ColumnStore Rename Table

The RENAME TABLE statement renames one or more ColumnStore tables.

Notes:

* You cannot currently use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another.
* See the ALTER TABLE syntax for an alternate to RENAME table. The following statement renames the orders table:

```
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_order;
```

The following statement renames both the _orders_ table and _customer_ table:

```
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_orders,customer TO customers;
```

You may also use RENAME TABLE to swap tables. This example swaps the _customer_ and _vendor_ tables (assuming the _temp\_table_\
does not already exist):

```
RENAME TABLE customer TO temp_table, vendor TO customer,temp_table to vendor;
```
