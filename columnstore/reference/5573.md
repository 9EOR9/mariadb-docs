# ColumnStore Rename Table

The RENAME TABLE statement renames one or more ColumnStore tables.

Notes:


* You cannot currently use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another.
* See the ALTER TABLE syntax for an alternate to RENAME table. The following statement renames the orders table:


```
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_order;
```

The following statement renames both the *orders* table and *customer* table:


```
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_orders,customer TO customers;
```

You may also use RENAME TABLE to swap tables. This example swaps the *customer* and *vendor* tables (assuming the *temp_table*
does not already exist):


```
RENAME TABLE customer TO temp_table, vendor TO customer,temp_table to vendor;
```
