### Why Choose Connector/C++?

While you can use MariaDB Connector/C for C++ applications, Connector/C++ offers specific advantages for C++ development:

| **Feature**         | **Connector/C++** | **Connector/C** |

| Executes SQL        | Yes               | Yes             |
| Object-Oriented     | Yes               | No              |
| Smart Pointers      | Yes               | No              |
| Implements JDBC API | Yes               | No              |

### Next Steps

To get started with MariaDB Connector/C++, you'll typically need to:

1. **Download the Connector/C++ library.** Look for the appropriate package for your operating system and development environment.
2. **Integrate the library into your C++ project.** This usually involves including header files and linking against the library during compilation.
3. **Write C++ code** to establish a connection, execute SQL queries, and process results using the object-oriented API.
