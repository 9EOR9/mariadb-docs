# MariaDB Connector/C Guide

## MariaDB Connector/C Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with **MariaDB Connector/C**, the client library used to connect C/C++ applications to MariaDB and MySQL databases. It's LGPL licensed and is being integrated directly into MariaDB Server distributions.

### Installation

MariaDB Connector/C is often distributed with MariaDB Server packages, but you can also install it separately.

#### Download Packages

You can download MariaDB Connector/C packages directly:

* **From the downloads page:** Select your desired version from the main MariaDB Connector/C download page.
* **By product selection:** Choose "C/C++ connector" as the Product on the MariaDB downloads page.

#### Install with a Package Manager (Recommended for Linux)

If you're using Linux, the simplest way to install MariaDB Connector/C is via your system's package manager. Your system needs to be configured to install from a MariaDB repository (version 10.2 or later).

You can set up your repository using:

* MariaDB Corporation's [MariaDB Package Repository setup script](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-package-repositories/\&authuser=1).
* MariaDB Foundation's [MariaDB Repository Configuration Tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mariadb.org/download/connector-c/\&authuser=1).

**Install with `yum`/`dnf` (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)**

For RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and similar distributions, use `yum` or `dnf`:

To install the shared library:

```bash
sudo yum install MariaDB-shared
```

To install the development package (if you're building applications):

```bash
sudo yum install MariaDB-devel
```

**Install with `apt-get` (Debian, Ubuntu)**

For Debian, Ubuntu, and similar distributions, use `apt-get`:

To install the shared library:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadb3
```

To install the development package (if you're building applications):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev
```

**Install with `zypper` (SLES, OpenSUSE)**

For SLES, OpenSUSE, and similar distributions, use `zypper`:

To install the shared library:

```bash
sudo zypper install MariaDB-shared
```

To install the development package (if you're building applications):

```bash
sudo zypper install MariaDB-devel
```

#### Install on Windows

MariaDB Connector/C for Windows is distributed as MSI packages. The installation process is straightforward, with both 32-bit and 64-bit MSI packages available.

#### Install from Source

If you prefer to build from source, refer to the [Building Connector/C From Source](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mariadb.com/kb/en/building-connector-c-from-source/\&authuser=1) documentation.

### API Reference

MariaDB Connector/C provides an API that is compatible with MySQL Connector/C for MySQL 5.5.

You can find the function reference at:

* [MariaDB Client Library for C API Functions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-client-library-for-c-api-functions/)
* [MariaDB Client Library for C API Prepared Statement Functions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-client-library-for-c-api-prepared-statement-functions/)

An HTML version is also available for download in `mariadb-client-doc.zip`.

### Configuration with Option Files

Similar to MariaDB Server, MariaDB Connector/C can read configuration options from client option groups in option files.

For detailed information, see [Configuring MariaDB Connector/C with Option Files](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-connector-c-with-option-files/\&authuser=1).

### Known Issues

Be aware of these potential limitations:

* Double-to-string conversion for prepared statements may not work correctly.
* Connector versions 3.0.7 and below do not support MySQL 8.0's default authentication protocol, `caching_sha2_password`. This should be supported in Connector/C 3.0.8 and above.

### Need Help or Want to Contribute?

* **Report Bugs:** If you encounter a bug, please report it via the [CONC project on MariaDB's Jira bug tracker](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC).
* **Source Code:** The source code is available on GitHub in the [mariadb-connector-c repository](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-connector-c).
