# mysql\_real\_connect

## Syntax

```c
MYSQL * mysql_real_connect(MYSQL * mysql,
                           const char * host,
                           const char * user,
                           const char * passwd,
                           const char * db,
                           unsigned int port,
                           const char * unix_socket,
                           unsigned long flags);
```

* `mysql` - a mysql handle, which was previously allocated by [mysql\_init()](mysql_init.md).
* `host` - can be either a host name or an IP address. Passing the NULL value or the string "localhost" to this parameter, the local host is assumed. When possible, pipes will be used instead of the TCP/IP protocol.
* `user` - the user name.
* `passwd` - If provided or NULL, the server will attempt to authenticate the user against those user records which have no password only. This allows one username to be used with different permissions (depending on if a password as provided or not).
* `db` - if provided will specify the default database to be used when performing queries.
* `port` - specifies the port number to attempt to connect to the server.
* `unix_socket` - specifies the socket or named pipe that should be used.
* `flags` - the flags allows various connection options to be set:
  * `CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS`: Return the number of matched rows instead of number of changed rows.
  * `CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA`: Forbids the use of database.tablename.column syntax and forces the SQL parser to generate an error.
  * `CLIENT_COMPRESS`: Use compression protocol
  * `CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE`: Allows spaces after function names. All function names will become reserved words.
  * `CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES`: Allows LOAD DATA LOCAL statements
  * `CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS`: Allows the client to send multiple statements in one command. Statements will be divided by a semicolon.
  * `CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS`: Indicates that the client is able to handle multiple result sets from stored procedures or multi statements. This option will be automatically set if CLIENT\_MULTI\_STATEMENTS is set.
  * And others per [protocol capabilities](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/server-client-software/client-libraries/clientserver-protocol/1-connecting/connection#capabilities).

## Description

Establishes a connection to a database server. Returns a MYSQL \* handle or NULL if an error occurred.

{% hint style="info" %}
The password doesn't need to be encrypted before executing mysql\_real\_connect(). This will be handled in the client server protocol.

The connection handle can't be reused for establishing a new connection. It must be closed and reinitialized before.
{% endhint %}
