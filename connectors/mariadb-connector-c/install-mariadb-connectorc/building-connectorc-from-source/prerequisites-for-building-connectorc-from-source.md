# Prerequisites For Building Connector/C From Source

#### Windows

* Visual Studio 2013 or newer (older versions of Visual Studio may also work but have not been tested).
* cmake 2.8.12 or newer, available from the [CMake website](https://www.cmake.org).
* for Connector/C 2.x: OpenSSL libraries and include files.
* for Connector/C 3.0 remote-io plugin: [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se) libraries and include files

#### Linux / Mac OS X

The following is a list of tools that are required for building MariaDB Connector/C on Linux and Mac OS X. Most, if not all, of these will exist as packages in your distribution's package repositories, so check there first.

* gcc 3.4.6 or newer C compiler
* TLS/SSL libraries and include files
  * OpenSSL 1.0.1 or newer or
  * GnuTLS 3.4 or newer
* cmake 2.8.12 or newer, available from the [CMake website](https://www.cmake.org).
* for Connector/C 3.0 remote-io plugin: [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se) libraries and include files
* For GSSAPI plugin: [Kerberos V5](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/) libraries

On Linux you can get those programs with your package manager. On Mac OS X you will need Xcode and to install the remaining programs with [Fink](https://www.finkproject.org/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).
