C++ applications can connect to MariaDB database products either with MariaDB Connector/C++ or [MariaDB Connector/C](../mariadb-connector-c/).

Using MariaDB Connector/C++ in C++ applications enables design with an object-oriented model and enables efficient dynamic memory allocation/de-allocation with smart pointers.
