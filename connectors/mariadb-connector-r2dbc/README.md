# Java R2DBC Connector

Java developers can use MariaDB Connector/R2DBC to connect to MariaDB database products using the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) API. R2DBC operations are non-blocking, which makes the R2DBC API more scalable than Java's standard JDBC API. MariaDB Connector/R2DBC is available both with a native R2DBC implementation and the Spring Data R2DBC framework.

The connector can be downloaded from [mariadb.com](https://mariadb.com/downloads/connectors/connectors-data-access/r2dbc-connector/)
