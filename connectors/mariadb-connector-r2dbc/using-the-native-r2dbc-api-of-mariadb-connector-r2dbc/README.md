# Using the Native R2DBC API of MariaDB Connector/R2DBC

## Overview

Java developers can use MariaDB Connector/R2DBC to connect to MariaDB database products using the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) API. R2DBC operations are non-blocking, which makes it more scalable than Java's standard JDBC API.

This page discusses using MariaDB Connector/R2DBC with the native R2DBC API.

For information on how to use MariaDB Connector/R2DBC with the Spring Data Framework, refer to [Using Spring Data with MariaDB Connector/R2DBC](../using-the-spring-data-framework-with-mariadb-connector-r2dbc/).
