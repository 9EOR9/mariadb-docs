# Contributing to the MariaDB Jupyter Kernel Project

Welcome! <3\
The MariaDB Jupyter Kernel is an Open-Source project licensed under BSD-new. Feel free to create new Issues for feature requests or bug reports. Code, tests, and documentation contributions are welcome :-)\
Friendly advice or feedback about the project counts as a contribution too!

Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb_kernel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\
file for information on:

1. How to set up development environment
2. Running the tests
3. Code formatting
4. Adding a new magic command

The reasoning for having the [Contributing](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb_kernel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation on GitHub is that it is closer to the actual code and it feels right to have it there. We also believe it fosters a cozy and welcoming environment for new contributors if both the code and the [Contributing](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb_kernel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation sit near each other.
