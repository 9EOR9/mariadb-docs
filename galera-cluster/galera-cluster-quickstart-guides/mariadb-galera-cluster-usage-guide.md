# MariaDB Galera Cluster Usage Guide

### Quickstart Guide: MariaDB Galera Cluster Usage

This guide provides essential information for effectively using and interacting with a running MariaDB Galera Cluster. It covers connection methods, operational considerations, monitoring, and best practices for applications.

#### 1. Connecting to the Cluster

Since Galera Cluster is multi-primary, any node can accept read and write connections.

a. Using a Load Balancer (Recommended for Production):

Deploying a load balancer or proxy (like MariaDB MaxScale, ProxySQL, or HAProxy) is the recommended approach.

* **MariaDB MaxScale:** Provides intelligent routing (e.g., `readwritesplit`, `router`), connection pooling, and advanced cluster awareness (e.g., `binlogrouter` for replication clients, `switchover` for failover).
* **Other Load Balancers:** Configure them to distribute connections across your Galera nodes, typically using health checks on port 3306 or other cluster-specific checks.

b. Direct Connection:

You can connect directly to any individual node's IP address or hostname using standard MariaDB client tools or connectors (e.g., mariadb command-line client, MariaDB Connector/J, Connector/Python).

*   **Example (Command-line):**&#x42;ash

    ```bash
    mariadb -h <node_ip_address> -u <username> -p
    ```

    While simple, this method lacks automatic failover; your application would need to handle connection retries and failover logic.

#### 2. Basic Operations (Reads & Writes)

* **Active-Active:** You can perform both read and write operations on _any_ node in the cluster. All successful write operations are synchronously replicated to all other nodes.
* **Transactions:** Standard SQL transactions (`START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) work as expected. Galera handles the replication of committed transactions.

#### 3. DDL (Data Definition Language) Operations

DDL operations (like `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`) require special attention in a synchronous multi-primary cluster to avoid conflicts and outages.

* **Total Order Isolation (TOI) - Default:**
  * This is Galera's default DDL method.
  * The DDL statement is executed on all nodes in the same order, and it temporarily blocks other transactions on all nodes while it applies.
  * It ensures consistency but can cause brief pauses in application activity, especially on busy clusters.
  * **Best Practice:** Execute DDL during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods.
* **Rolling Schema Upgrade (RSU) / Percona's `pt-online-schema-change`:**
  * For large tables or critical production systems, use tools like `pt-online-schema-change` (from Percona Toolkit) which performs DDL without blocking writes.
  * This tool works by creating a new table, copying data, applying changes, and then swapping the tables. It's generally preferred for minimizing downtime for `ALTER TABLE` operations.
* **`wsrep_OSU_method`:**
  * This system variable controls how DDL operations are executed.
  * `TOI` (default): Total Order Isolation.
  * `RSU`: Rolling Schema Upgrade (requires manual steps with `pt-online-schema-change`).
  * `NBO` (Non-Blocking Operations): A newer method allowing non-blocking DDL for some operations, but not fully implemented for all DDL types. Use with caution and test thoroughly.

#### 4. Monitoring Cluster Status

Regularly monitor your Galera Cluster to ensure its health and consistency.

*   **`wsrep_cluster_size`:** Number of nodes currently in the Primary Component.SQL

    ```
    SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';
    ```

    Expected value: the total number of nodes configured (e.g., 3).
* **`wsrep_local_state_comment` / `wsrep_local_state`:** The state of the current node.
  * `Synced` (4): Node is fully synchronized and operational.
  * `Donor/Desync` (2): Node is transferring state to another node.
  * `Joining` (1): Node is in the process of joining the cluster.
  * `Donor/Stalled` (1): Node is stalled.
* **`wsrep_incoming_addresses`:** List of incoming connections from other cluster nodes.
* **`wsrep_cert_deps_distance`:** Indicates flow control. A high value suggests that this node is falling behind and flow control may activate.
* **`wsrep_flow_control_paused`:** Percentage of time the node was paused due to flow control. High values indicate a bottleneck.
* **`wsrep_local_recv_queue` / `wsrep_local_send_queue`:** Size of the receive/send queue. Ideally, these should be close to 0. Sustained high values indicate replication lag or node issues.

#### 5. Handling Node Failures and Recovery

Galera Cluster is designed for automatic recovery, but understanding the process is key.

* **Node Failure:** If a node fails, the remaining nodes continue to operate as the Primary Component. The failed node will automatically attempt to rejoin when it comes back online.
* **Split-Brain Scenarios:** If the network partitions the cluster, nodes will try to form a "Primary Component." The partition with the majority of nodes forms the new Primary Component. If no majority can be formed (e.g., a 2-node cluster splits), the cluster will become inactive. A 3-node or higher cluster is recommended to avoid this.
* **Manual Bootstrapping (Last Resort):** If the entire cluster goes down or a split-brain occurs where no Primary Component forms, you might need to manually "bootstrap" a new Primary Component from one of the healthy nodes.
  * Choose the node that was most up-to-date.
  * Stop MariaDB on that node.
  * Start it with: `sudo galera_new_cluster` or `sudo systemctl start mariadb --wsrep-new-cluster`.
  * Start other nodes normally; they will rejoin the bootstrapped component.

#### 6. Application Best Practices

* **Use Connection Pooling:** Essential for managing connections efficiently in high-traffic applications.
* **Short Transactions:** Keep transactions as short and concise as possible to minimize conflicts and improve throughput. Long-running transactions increase the risk of rollbacks due to certification failures.
* **Primary Keys:** All tables should have a primary key. Galera relies on primary keys for efficient row-level replication. Tables without primary keys can cause performance degradation and issues.
* **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic in your application for failed transactions (e.g., due to certification failures, deadlock, or temporary network issues).
* **Connect to a Load Balancer:** Always direct your application's connections through a load balancer or proxy to leverage automatic failover and intelligent routing.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and operate your MariaDB Galera Cluster for high availability and performance.
