* Dynamic: No
* Default: `no`

#### `gcs.fc_single_primary`

* Description: Defines whether there is more than one source of replication.\
  As the number of nodes in the cluster grows, the larger the calculated gcs.fc\_limit gets. At the same time, the number of writes from the nodes increases.\
  When this parameter value is set to NO (multi-primary), the gcs.fc\_limit parameter is dynamically modified to give more margin for each node to be a bit further behind applying writes.\
  The gcs.fc\_limit parameter is modified by the square root of the cluster size, that is, in a four-node cluster it is two times higher than the base value. This is done to compensate for the increasing replication rate noise.
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `no`

#### `gcs.max_packet_size`

* Description: Maximum packet size, after which writesets become fragmented.
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `64500`

#### `gcs.recv_q_soft_limit`

* Description: Fraction of [gcs.recv\_q\_hard\_limit](wsrep_provider_options.md#gcsrecv_q_hard_limit) after which replication rate is throttled. The rate of throttling increases linearly from zero (the regular, varying rate of replication) at and below `csrecv_q_soft_limit` to one (full throttling) at [gcs.recv\_q\_hard\_limit](wsrep_provider_options.md#gcsrecv_q_hard_limit)
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `0.25`

* Dynamic: No
* Default: `PT3S`

#### `gmcast.segment`

* Description: Defines the segment to which the node belongs. By default, all nodes are placed in the same segment (`0`). Usually, you would place all nodes in the same datacenter in the same segment. Galera protocol traffic is only redirected to one node in each segment, and then relayed to other nodes in that same segment, which saves cross-datacenter network traffic at the expense of some extra latency. State transfers are also, preferably but not exclusively, taken from the same segment. If there are no nodes available in the same segment, state transfer will be taken from a node in another segment.
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `0`
* Range: `0` to `255`

#### `gmcast.time_wait`

* Dynamic: No
* Default: `false`

#### `pc.recovery`

* Description: If set to `true` (the default), the Primary Component state is stored on disk and in the case of a full cluster crash (e.g power outages), automatic recovery is then possible. Subsequent graceful full cluster restarts will require explicit bootstrapping for a new Primary Component.

  * `1` OOOC: Out-of-order committing is permitted for all transactions.
  * `2` LOCAL\_OOOC: Out-of-order committing is permitted for local transactions only.

Galera wsrep providers other than 25.3.x or 25.2.x are not supported.
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `2`

#### `socket.dynamic`

* Description: Allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections between nodes. Typically this should be set to `false` (the default), when set to `true` encrypted connections will still be preferred, but will fall back to unencrypted connections when encryption is not possible, e.g. not enabled on all nodes yet. Needs to be `true` on all nodes when wanting to enable or disable encryption via a rolling restart. As this can't be changed at runtime a rolling restart to enable or disable encryption may need three restarts per node in total: one to enable `socket.dynamic` on each node, one to change the actual encryption settings on each node, and a final round to change `socket.dynamic` back to `false`.
* Dynamic: No
* Default: `false`
