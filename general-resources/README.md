# About MariaDB Documentation

The documentation for MariaDB products is

* written in standard American English,
* using Markdown format,
* stored in Git.

It is maintained by a team of technical writers from [MariaDB plc](https://mariadb.com/) and the [MariaDB Foundation](https://mariadb.org/).

Until June 2025, the documentation used to be in the MariaDB KnowledgeBase (KB). With a few exceptions, mostly concerning outdated modules and functionality, all pages were migrated to a new platform, [GitBook](https://gitbook.com/).
