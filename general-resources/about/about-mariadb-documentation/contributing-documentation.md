# Contributing Documentation

_Instructions for contributing to documentation._

* _Decide which spaces people can contribute to_
* _Server has CC/FDL license_
* _MariaDB plc will have the IP in any case, contributors would have to agree to that_
* _Contributions = suggestions_

The documentation for MariaDB products is

* written in standard American English,
* using Markdown format,
* stored in Git.

Being stored in Git, it allows anyone to contribute to the documentation. You need [a GitHub account](https://github.com/), [a basic knowledge of Markdown](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/markdown/), and some expertise in what you’re writing about. You also have to agree to our [contributor agreement](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

Contributing is as simple as this:

* Access [this repository](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], log in with your GitHub account.
* Find the page in the documentation that you want to edit, correct, or amend.
* Make a pull request, edit, and submit.

The MariaDB documentation team will review your edits, smooth out any rough edges (language and style), and incorporate your contribution into the documentation. Don’t be afraid to submit imperfect contributions, as long as they’re factually correct.

Before you start, make yourself familiar with [the basics of technical writing](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) (a 1-minute read). This is about using proper tone and content, language and grammar, as well as formatting, punctuation, and organization.

The source format of pages is Markdown. How to format text is [on this GitBook page](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/markdown). A Markdown cheat sheet with a 10-minute tutorial and a Markdown "playground" [can be found here](https://commonmark.org/help/).

Read our [style guide](documentation-style-guide.md), too. (It's short!)
