# Documentation Style Guide

**We adhere to the** [**Google developer documentation style guide**](https://developers.google.com/style/)**.** Here are some links to particularly important resources from that style guide:

* [Word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) – an alphabetically ordered list that allows you to quickly find words to use, or not to use, and recommendations of words and terms to use.
* [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility) – write inclusive documentation for a global audience.
* [Timeless documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/timeless-documentation) – avoid words and terms like _currently_, _existing_, _in the future_, _now_, or _soon_.
* [Capitalization](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization) – when to use the Shift key, and how to format [headings and titles](https://developers.google.com/style/headings). We use upper case for headings, which is about the only deviation from the Google style guide.
* [Abbreviations](https://developers.google.com/style/abbreviations) – how to use acronyms and initialisms.
* [Punctuation](https://developers.google.com/style/colons) – how to properly use colons, commas, dashes, etc.
* [Formatting and organization](https://developers.google.com/style/dates-times) – how to write dates and times, headings and titles, when to use [lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists) or rather [tables](https://developers.google.com/style/tables).
* [Cross-references](https://developers.google.com/style/cross-references) – how to properly write links.
* [Code samples](https://developers.google.com/style/code-samples) – how to write and format code blocks.
* [Example domain names, IP numbers, and person names](https://developers.google.com/style/examples) – and how to use filenames and trademarks.
