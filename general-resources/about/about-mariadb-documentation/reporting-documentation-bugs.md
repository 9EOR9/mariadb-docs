# Reporting Documentation Issues

## Bug Reports

If you find issues in the documentation, please report them:

1. Report only **one issue per request**. If you find multiple issues, report them one by one. \
   Only report documentation issues, not software issues or software help requests.
2. Provide the **URL of the page** that has an issue, for example [https://mariadb.net/docs/general-resources/community/company-and-community/bug-tracking/reporting-documentation-bugs](https://mariadb.net/docs/general-resources/community/company-and-community/bug-tracking/reporting-documentation-bugs).
3. Indicate the **nature of the issue**:
   1. **Typo**, for example "known bucks should be known bugs".
   2. **Wrong** information. Provide details of what's wrong. Ideally, point out what the right information should be.
   3. **Missing** information. Provide details of what's missing.
   4. **Unclear** information. Provide details of what's unclear. Ideally, provide a clarification.

## Reporting Channels

### Rating system in the right sidebar

This is a super quick way to provide feedback or report issues in the documentation. However, it's one-way communication â€” we can't provide feedback to you, since we don't know who you are. :innocent:

One of the smiley icons is selected, which opens a text field to provide feedback. Rating and feedback are sent with a Submit button." width="223"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

### MariaDB Community Slack

Join the `#documentation` channel in [MariaDB Community Slack](https://r.mariadb.com/join-community-slack). This allows for more detailed feedback or reports, and naturally provides two-way communication.
