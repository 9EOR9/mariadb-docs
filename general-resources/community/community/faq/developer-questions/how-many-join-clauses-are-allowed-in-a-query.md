# How many JOIN Clauses are Allowed in a Query?

According to MySQL docs: [joins-limits.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/joins-limits.html)

The maximum number of tables that can be referenced in a single join is 61. This also applies to the number of tables that can be referenced in the definition of a view.

Does the same maximum (61) applies to MariaDB, too?

If yes, are there plans for raising this limit?
