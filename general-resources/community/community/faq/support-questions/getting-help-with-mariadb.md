# Getting Help With MariaDB

If you can't find help in the [MariaDB documentation](../../../../../kb/en/mariadb-documentation/), you can also subscribe to the [mailing lists](../../../../faq/support-questions/broken-reference/) or [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com) to communicate with MariaDB users and developers.

There's an active help community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming with SQL and indexing questions, and [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/) for non-programming questions for example tuning/backups/architecture/migration/replication etc. Use the _mariadb_ tag so questions are searchable by those that can help you.

If you have a question about a feature that is not properly documented or something that is not working as expected, go to the corresponding [Knowledge Base page](../../../../../kb/en/mariadb/) and ask your question there.

You can report and check on bugs which apply to MariaDB in [JIRA](../../../../development-articles/general-info/tools/jira.md).

[MariaDB plc](https://mariadb.com) offers [commercial support](https://mariadb.com/services/mariadb-mysql-subscription-services).
