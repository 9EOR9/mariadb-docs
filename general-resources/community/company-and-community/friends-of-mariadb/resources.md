# MariaDB Users & Developers

## GitHub and Mailing Lists

The MariaDB project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/). A good way to get started is to join one of the mailing lists:

* The [discuss](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/discuss.lists.mariadb.org/) mailing list is for MariaDB users and general discussion. The archive can be found [here](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/discuss@lists.mariadb.org/).
* The [docs](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/docs.lists.mariadb.org/) mailing list is for those interested in documentation for MariaDB. The archive can be found [here](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/docs@lists.mariadb.org/).
* The [developers](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/developers.lists.mariadb.org/) mailing list is for those who want to contribute code to the project or otherwise closely monitor MariaDB development. The archive can be found [here](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/developers@lists.mariadb.org/).

## MariaDB Commits List

The [commit emails](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/commits@lists.mariadb.org/) are sent to [commits 'at' lists (dot) mariadb (dot) org](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/commits@lists.mariadb.org/). Anyone can [subscribe to commit emails](https://lists.mariadb.org/accounts/signup/?next=/hyperkitty/list/commits%40lists.mariadb.org/)\
or examine the [commit archive](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/commits@lists.mariadb.org/).

## MariaDB Announcements List

If you want to just want to keep up with the latest news, like new MariaDB\
releases, you should [subscribe](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/announce.lists.mariadb.org/) to the[announce 'at' lists (dot) mariadb (dot) org](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/announce.lists.mariadb.org/) announcement list (this is a low traffic, announce-only list). You can also examine the [announce archive](https://lists.mariadb.org/hyperkitty/list/announce@lists.mariadb.org/).

## Zulip

MariaDB has a Zulip instance. Zulip is an open-source tool that provides IRC and Slack-like functionality. Visit it at [mariadb.zulipchat.com](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com).

## IRC

The Maria project's official [IRC](../../../../kb/en/irc/) channel is #maria on.\
Users are asked to keep their best interests in mind when interacting with busy developers in our big tent.

## Conferences

You can also meet MariaDB people at many open source conferences. See the list of conferences attended by MariaDB developers at.

## Feature Requests

If you have a feature request, you can file it in [JIRA](../../../development-articles/general-development-information/tools/jira.md). If you are\
prepared to pay for the feature you can contact the[MariaDB Corporation](https://mariadb.com/) to get a quote. You can of course also fix it yourself and become a [MariaDB contributor/developer](../../contributing-participating/contributing-to-the-mariadb-project.md).

## The MariaDB Knowledge Base

The [Knowledge Base](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/the-mariadb-library/) contains documentation, FAQs, troubleshooting articles, tutorials, and a place where you can ask and answer questions about specific MariaDB software.

## Distribution Mailing Lists

* [Debian MariaDB/MySQL maintainers](https://alioth-lists.debian.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-mysql-maint)
