# Contributing to the MariaDB Project

#### How to Contribute to MariaDB

_The success of MariaDB relies heavily on community involvement. You can contribute in various ways, even if you are not a developer:_

* _**Bug Reporting**: Create an account to report bugs._
* _**Knowledge Sharing**: Answer questions in the Knowledge Base or on IRC and Zulip._
* _**Testing**: Upload bug tests to the FTP server for private testing._
* _**Documentation**: Write or translate articles and documentation for MariaDB._
* _**Advocacy**: Promote MariaDB and participate in open source events._
* _**Support**: Donate time or resources, or engage your company in supporting MariaDB._

_Explore more ways to get involved on the_ [_MariaDB Foundation page_](https://mariadb.org/get-involved/)_._

The success of [MariaDB](../../../kb/en/mariadb/) depends on the participation of the[community](../../../kb/en/community/). MariaDB would not be as good as it is today without the participation of the entire [MariaDB community](../../../kb/en/community/).

## Getting Started

There are several ways to contribute besides [Contributing Code](contributing-code.md), and not all of them require\
strong C/C++ skills. Areas for non-developers include:

* [Reporting Bugs](../community/bug-tracking/reporting-bugs.md)
  * To report a bug you'll need to sign up for an account by clicking on the Create an account link below the login fields
* [Suggesting Features](../../development-articles/general-info/tools/jira.md)
* [Answering questions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/+questions/) in the Knowledge Base
* Helping other people answering problems or even fixing their bugs on [IRC](../../../kb/en/irc/) in the #maria channel on [Libera.Chat](../../../kb/en/irc/) or on MariaDB's Zulip instance at [mariadb.zulipchat.com](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com).
* Testing and Benchmarking
  * Bug tests can be uploaded to the 'private' directory of our [FTP](../../../kb/en/ftp/) server.
* Creating [documentation and KB articles](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/writing-and-editing-knowledge-base-articles) for MariaDB, or [translating existing documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/translation-howto/).
* Advocating MariaDB in your area.
* Participate in [open source events](https://mariadb.org/events/) and talk about MariaDB.
* Running a [BuildBot](../../development-articles/general-info/tools/buildbot/) on a platform which is not currently [builders](https://buildbot.mariadb.org/#/builders).
* [Donate](https://mariadb.org/donate/) time or money to the MariaDB project.
* Ask your company to [sponsor a feature](sponsoring-the-mariadb-project.md).

### MariaDB Email Lists

A great way to get started in MariaDB is to participate in e-mail discussions\
via our mailing lists (whichever list best matches your interests):

* [developers](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/developers.lists.mariadb.org/)
* [discuss](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/discuss.lists.mariadb.org)
* [docs](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/docs.lists.mariadb.org)

Sensitive security issues can be sent directly to the persons responsible for MariaDB security: security \[AT] mariadb (dot) org.

You can find additional email address, email archives and ways to connect with MariaDB people [here](broken-reference).

All MariaDB contributors are expected to follow the[Ubuntu Code Of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct).
