# Google Summers of Code

MariaDB has participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) since 2013. Below is a list of links to pages providing information for each year.

The [MariaDB Foundation](https://www.mariadb.org) believes we are making a better database that remains application compatible with MySQL. We also work on making LGPL connectors (currently [C](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-c), [ODBC](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-odbc), [Java](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-j), [Node.js](../../../../en/nodejs-connector/)) and on [MariaDB Galera Cluster](../../../../en/galera/), which allows you to scale your reads & writes. Lately, we also have [MariaDB ColumnsStore](../../../../en/mariadb-columnstore/), which is a columnar storage engine, designed to process petabytes of data with real-time response to analytical queries.
