| 3024       |          | ER\_QUERY\_TIMEOUT | Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded |

## Possible Causes and Solutions

The cause is that the executing statement took more than [max\_statement\_time](../../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_statement_time) (primary) or [slave\_max\_statement\_time](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md#slave_max_statement_time) (replica) to execute.

To fix this, you have to either increase the value of [max\_statement\_time](../../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_statement_time) or find out [why the query is slow](../../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/). Start by doing an [EXPLAIN](../../../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/analyze-and-explain-statements/explain.md) or [ANALYZE](../../../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/analyze-and-explain-statements/analyze-statement.md) on the query to find out how the query is executed.
