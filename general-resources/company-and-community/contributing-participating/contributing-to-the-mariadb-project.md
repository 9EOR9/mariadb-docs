# Contributing to the MariaDB Project

The success of [MariaDB](../../../columnstore/using-mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-with-spark.md) depends on the participation of the
[community](../../../server/reference/faq/community-questions/README.md). MariaDB would not be as good as it is today without the
participation of the entire [MariaDB community](../../../server/reference/faq/community-questions/README.md).


## Getting Started


There are several ways to contribute besides [Contributing Code](contributing-code.md), and not all of them require
strong C/C++ skills. Areas for non-developers include:


* [Reporting Bugs](../../../server/reference/bug-tracking/reporting-bugs.md)

  * To report a bug you'll need to sign up for an account by clicking on the Create an account link below the login fields
* [Suggesting Features](../../learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/jira.md)
* [Answering questions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/+questions/) in the Knowledge Base
* Helping other people answering problems or even fixing their bugs on [IRC](/kb/en/irc/) in the #maria channel on [Libera.Chat](/kb/en/irc/) or on MariaDB's Zulip instance at [mariadb.zulipchat.com](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com).
* Testing and Benchmarking

  * Bug tests can be uploaded to the 'private' directory of our [FTP](/kb/en/ftp/) server.
* Creating [documentation and KB articles](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/meta/writing-and-editing-knowledge-base-articles) for MariaDB, or [translating existing documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/translation-howto/).
* Advocating MariaDB in your area.
* Participate in [open source events](https://mariadb.org/events/) and talk about MariaDB.
* Running a [BuildBot](../../learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/buildbot/buildbot-setup/buildbot-setup-for-virtual-machines/buildbot-setup-for-virtual-machines-debian/buildbot-setup-for-virtual-machines-debian-4-i386.md) on a platform which is not currently [builders](https://buildbot.mariadb.org/#/builders).
* [Donate](donate-to-the-foundation.md) time or money to the MariaDB project.
* Ask your company to [sponsor a feature](sponsoring-the-mariadb-project.md).
* [MariaDB Foundation page on getting involved](https://mariadb.org/get-involved/)


**[Contributing to the Knowledge Base](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/contributing-to-the-askmonty-knowledgebase/)** is a great way to help improve MariaDB.


### MariaDB Email Lists


A great way to get started in MariaDB is to participate in e-mail discussions
via our mailing lists (whichever list best matches your interests):


* [developers](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/developers.lists.mariadb.org/)
* [discuss](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/discuss.lists.mariadb.org)
* [docs](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/docs.lists.mariadb.org)


Sensitive security issues can be sent directly to the persons responsible for MariaDB security: security [AT] mariadb (dot) org.


You can find additional email address, email archives and ways to connect with MariaDB people [here](../friends-of-mariadb/resources.md).


All MariaDB contributors are expected to follow the
[Ubuntu Code Of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct).
