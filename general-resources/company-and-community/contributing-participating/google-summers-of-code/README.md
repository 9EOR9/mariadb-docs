# Google Summers of Code

MariaDB has participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) since 2013. Below is a list of links to pages providing information for each year.


The [MariaDB Foundation](https://www.mariadb.org) believes we are making a better database that remains application compatible with MySQL. We also work on making LGPL connectors (currently [C](../../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-cpp/mariadb-connector-cpp-sample-application.md), [ODBC](../../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-odbc/README.md), [Java](../../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-j/mariadb-connector-j-releases.md), [Node.js](/en/nodejs-connector/)) and on [MariaDB Galera Cluster](../../../../server/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/built-in-functions/special-functions/galera-functions/README.md), which allows you to scale your reads & writes. Lately, we also have [MariaDB ColumnsStore](../../../../columnstore/using-mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-with-spark.md), which is a columnar storage engine, designed to process petabytes of data with real-time response to analytical queries.
