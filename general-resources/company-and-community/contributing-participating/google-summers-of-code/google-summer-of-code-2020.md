# Google Summer of Code 2020

We are participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020. The [MariaDB Foundation](https://www.mariadb.org) believes we are making a better database that remains application compatible with MySQL. We also work on making LGPL connectors (currently C, ODBC, Java) and on [MariaDB Galera Cluster](../../../../server/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/built-in-functions/special-functions/galera-functions/README.md), which allows you to scale your reads & writes. And we have [MariaDB ColumnStore](../../../../columnstore/using-mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-with-spark.md), which is a columnar storage engine, designed to process petabytes of data with real-time response to analytical queries.

# List of Tasks


## MariaDB Server: Optimizer



### Evaluate subquery predicates earlier or later depending on their SELECTIVITY

(Based on conversation with Igor)
There are a lot of subquery conditions out there that are inexpensive to
evaluate and have good selectivity.
If we just implement [MDEV-83](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-83), we may get regressions. We need to take
subquery condition's selectivity into account.
It is difficult to get a meaningful estimate for an arbitrary, correlated
subquery predicate.
One possible solution is to measure selectivity during execution and reattach
predicates on the fly.
We don't want to change the query plan all the time, one way to dynamically
move items between item trees is to wrap them inside Item_func_trig_cond so
we can switch them on and off.

### Histograms with equal-width bins in MariaDB

Histograms with equal-width bins are easy to construct using samples. For this it's enough
to look through the given sample set and for each value from it to figure out what bin this value can be placed in. Each bin requires only one counter.
Let f be a column of a table with N rows and n be the number of samples by which the equal-width histogram of k bins for this column is constructed. Let after looking through all sample
rows the counters created for the histogram bins contain numbers c[1],..,c[k]. Then
m[i]= c[i]/n * 100 is the percentage of the rows whose values of f are expected to be in the interval

```
(max(f)-min(f))/k *(i-1), max(f)-min(f))/k *i-1).
```
It means that if the sample rows have been chosen randomly the expected number of rows with the values of f from this interval can be approximated by the number m[i]*/100 * N.
To collect such statistics it is suggested to use the following variant of the ANALYZE TABLE command:

```
ANALYZE FAST TABLE tbl [ WITH n ROWS ] [SAMPLING p PERCENTS ]
   PERSISTENT FOR COLUMNS (col1 [IN RANGE r] [WITH k INTERVALS],...)
```
Here:

* 'WITH n ROWS' provides an estimate for the number of rows in the table in the case when this estimate cannot be obtained from statistical data.
* 'SAMPLING p PERCENTS' provides the percentage of sample rows to collect statistics. If this is omitted the number is taken from the system variable samples_ratio.
* 'IN RANGE r' sets the range of equal-width bins of the histogram built for the column col1. If this is omitted then and min and max values for the column can be read from statistical data then the histogram is built for the range [min(col1), max(col1)]. Otherwise the range [MIN_type(col1), MAX_type(col1) is considered]. The values beyond the given range, if any, are also is taken into account in two additional bins.
* WITH k INTERVALS says how many bins are included in the histogram. If it is omitted this value is taken from the system variable histogram_size.

### Add FULL OUTER JOIN to MariaDB

Add support for FULL OUTER JOIN
[sql_join_full.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_full.asp)
One of the way how to implement is to re-write the query

```
select t1.*, t2.* from t1 full outer join t2 on P(t1,t2)
```
into the following union all:

```
select t1.*, t2.* from t1 left outer join t2 on P(t1,t2) 
union all 
select t1.*,t2.* from t2 left outer join t1 on P(t1,t2) where t1.a is null
```
Here t1.a is some non-nullable column of t1 (e.g. the column of single column primary key).

```
CREATE TABLE tree (
       `Node` VARCHAR(3),
       `ParentNode` VARCHAR(3),
       `EmployeeID` INTEGER,
       `Depth` INTEGER,
       `Lineage` VARCHAR(16)
     );

     INSERT INTO tree
       (`Node`, `ParentNode`, `EmployeeID`, `Depth`, `Lineage`)
     VALUES
       ('100', NULL, '1001', 0, '/'),
       ('101', '100', '1002', NULL, NULL),
       ('102', '101', '1003', NULL, NULL),
       ('103', '102', '1004', NULL, NULL),
       ('104', '102', '1005', NULL, NULL),
       ('105', '102', '1006', NULL, NULL);
 
     WITH RECURSIVE prev AS (
     SELECT * FROM tree WHERE ParentNode IS NULL
     UNION
     SELECT t.Node,t.ParentNode,t.EmployeeID,p.Depth + 1 as Depth, CONCAT(p.Lineage, t.ParentNode, '/')
     FROM tree t JOIN prev p ON t.ParentNode = p.Node
     )
     SELECT * FROM prev;

     WITH RECURSIVE prev AS (
     SELECT * FROM tree WHERE ParentNode IS NULL
     UNION
     SELECT t.Node,t.ParentNode,t.EmployeeID,p.Depth + 1 as Depth, CONCAT(p.Lineage, t.ParentNode, '/')
     FROM prev p JOIN tree t ON t.ParentNode = p.Node
     )
     UPDATE tree t, prev p SET t.Depth=p.Depth, t.Lineage=p.Lineage WHERE t.Node=p.Node; 

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'UPDATE tree t, prev p SET t.Depth=p.Depth, t.Lineage=p.Lineage WHERE t.Node=p.No' at line 7
```
supported in MySQL-8.0 and MSSQL

## MariaDB Server: others



### Support for GTID in mysqlbinlog

The mysqlbinlog client program needs to be updated to support GTID.
Here is a suggested list of things to be done:

* The `<code>--start-position</code>` and `<code>--stop-position</code>` options should be able to take
GTID positions; or maybe there should be new `<code>--start-gtid</code>` and `<code>--stop-gtid</code>`
options. Like `<code>--start-gtid=0-1-100,1-2-200,2-1-1000</code>`.
* A GTID position means the point just after that GTID. So starting from
GTID 0-1-100 and stopping at GTID 0-1-200, the first GTID output will
probably be 0-1-101 and the last one 0-1-200. Note that if some domain is
not specified in the position, it means to start from the begining,
respectively stop immediately in that domain.
* Starting and stopping GTID should work both with local files, and with `<code>--read-from-remote-server</code>`. For the latter, there are a couple of extra things that need doing in the master-slave protocol, see `<code>get_master_version_and_clock()</code>` in `<code>sql/slave.cc</code>`.
* At the end of the dump, put these statements, to reduce the risk of those session variables incorrectly spilling into subsequent statements run in the same session:


```
SET session.server_id = @@global.server_id,
       session.gtid_domain_id=@@global.gtid_domain_id;
```

### connection encryption plugin support

As a follow-on to [MDEV-4691](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4691) we would like GSSAPI encryption (in addition to authentication) support in MariaDB. I am told that the current plan is to create a plugin interface and then we can build GSSAPI encryption on top of that, so here is a ticket for that.
From having written GSSAPI for the internal interface, there were a couple things I would like to see in the plugin encryption interface.
First, GSSAPI is weird in that it does authentication before encryption (TLS/SSL are the other way around, establishing an encrypted channel and then doing authentication over it). Of course support for this is needed, but more importantly, packets must be processed in a fully serialized fashion. This is because encrypted packets may be queued while one end of the connection is still finishing up processing the authentication handshake. One way to do this is registering "handle" callbacks with connection-specific state, but there are definitely others.
Additionally, for whatever conception there ends up being of authentication and encryption, it needs to be possible to share more data than just a socket between them. The same context will be used for authentication and encryption, much as an SSL context is (except of course we go from authentication to encryption and not the other way around).
This ties into an issue of dependency. If authentication plugins are separate entities from encryption plugins in the final architecture, it might make sense to do mix-and-match authentication with encryption. However, there are cases - and GSSAPI is one - where doing encryption requires a certain kind of authentication (or vice versa). You can't do GSSAPI encryption without first doing GSSAPI authentication. (Whether or not it's permitted to do GSSAPI auth->encryption all over a TLS channel, for instance, is not something I'm concerned about.)
Finally, encrypted messages are larger than their non-encrypted counterparts. The transport layer should cope with this so that plugins don't have to think about reassembly, keeping in mind that there may not be a way to get the size of a message when encrypted without first encrypting it.
It's unfortunately been a little while since I wrote that code, but I think those were the main things that we'll need for GSSAPI. Thanks!

### Aggregate Window Functions

With a few exceptions, most native aggregate functions are supported as window functions.
[aggregate-functions-as-window-functions.md](../../../../server/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/built-in-functions/special-functions/window-functions/aggregate-functions-as-window-functions.md)
In [MDEV-7773](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-7773), support for creating of custom aggregate functions was added.
This task proposes to extend that feature and allow custom aggregate functions to be used as window functions
An example of a creating a custom aggregate function is given below:

```
create aggregate function agg_sum(x INT) returns double
begin
  declare z double default 0;
  declare continue handler for not found return z;
  loop
    fetch group next row;
    set z = z + x;
  end loop;
end|
```
This functions can be used in the following query:

```
create table balances (id int, amount int);
insert into balances values (1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30);
 
select agg_sum(amount) from balances;
```
After this task is complete the following must also work:

```
select agg_sum(amount) over (order by id);
```

### Improve mysqltest language

mysqltest has a lot of historical problems:

* ad hoc parser, weird limitations
* commands added as needed with no view over the total language structure
* historical code issues (e.g. casts that become unnecessary 10 years ago)
etc

A lot can be done to improve it.
Ideas

* control structures, else in if, break and continue in while, for (or foreach) loop
* proper expression support in let, if, etc
* rich enough expressions to make resorting to sql unnecessary in most cases
* remove unused and redundant commands (e.g. system vs exec, query_vertical vs vertical_results ONCE)
* remove complex commands that do many sql statements under the hood, if they can be scripted, e.g. sync_slave_with_master
* remove over-verbose treatment of rpl test failures
* scoped variables
* parameters for the source command
* remove dead code

### Implement multiple-table UPDATE/DELETE returning a result set

A multiple-table UPDATE first performs join operations, then it updates the matching rows.
A multiple-table UPDATE returning a result set does the following:

* first performs join operations
* for each row of the result of the join it calculates some expressions over the columns of the join and forms from them a row of the returned result set
* after this it updates the matching rows

A multiple-table DELETE first performs join operations, then it deletes the matching rows.

### sort out the compression library chaos

As MariaDB is getting more storage engines and as they're getting more features, MariaDB can optionally use more and more compression libraries for various purposes.
InnoDB, TokuDB, RocksDB — they all can use different sets of compression libraries. Compiling them all in would result in a lot of run-time/rpm/deb dependencies, most of which will be never used by most of the users. Not compiling them in, would result in requests to compile them in. While most users don't use all these libraries, many users use some of these libraries.
A solution could be to load these libraries on request, without creating a packaging dependency. There are different ways to do it

* hide all compression libraries behind a single unified compression API. Either develop our own or use something like Squash. This would require changing all engines to use this API
* use the same approach as in server services — create a service per compression library, a service implementation will just return an error code for any function invocation if the corresponding library is not installed. this way — may be — we could avoid modifying all affected storage engines

### Control over memory allocated for SP/PS

SP/PS (Stored Procedures / Prepared Statements) allocates memory till the PS cache of SP will be destroyed. There is no way to see how many memory allocated and if it grows with each execution (first 2 execution can lead to new memory allocation but not more)

#### Task minimum:

Status variables which count the memory used/allocated for SP/PS by thread and/or for the server.

#### Other ideas:


* Automatic stop allocation in debvugging version after second execution and call exception on attempt.
* Information schema by threads and SP/PS with information about allocated and used memory

Information can be collected in MEM_ROOTs of SP/PS. Storing info about status of mem_root before execution then checking after new allocated memory can be found.
MEM_ROOT can be changed to have debug mode which make it read only which can be switched on after second execution.

## MariaDB ColumnStore



### Full DECIMAL support in ColumnStore

MariaDB ColumnStore supports DECIMAL with some limitations:
1. We do not support the full DECIMAL range that is in MariaDB
2. In several places in the code we convert the DECIMAL to DOUBLE during execution therefore losing precision
Implementing this will likely require the following:

* Implementation of methods to handle MariaDB's DECIMAL format
* Support for a longer than 8-byte numeric column type (there is an InfiniDB tree with work for this already)
* Modification of the primitives processor for the math
* Modification of the function expression processor to handle the new type
* Version upgrade support for DECIMAL from the current form to the new form

### Speed up RowGroup data access methods reducing level of inderection

RowGroup is the unit of the data sent around CS cluster. It is basically a set of records for fixed size data types + additional storage area for binary data, e.g. strings.
Right now there are lots of RowGroup methods that access RowGroup fixed size data using extra level of inderection. Here is the example:
return **((int64_t)** &data[offsets[colIndex]]);
This expression uses extra assembly instruction to calculate the effective address.
We want to remove 'offsets[colIndex]' part of this and similar expressions in RowGroup code.

### Parallel sorting 2nd phase

As of 1.4.1 CS uses two-phase sorting. Here are the phases:

* Presort partial runs of data.
* Merge the presorted partial runs produced during the 1st phase.
Here is more detailed explanation of how sorting works as of 1.4.1

CS gets a portion of records data from previous steps of the query execution(RGData instance from the ring buffer of RGData-s) and produces a sorting run out of it using existing sorting class LimitedOrderBy. If the query contains LIMIT then we apply it at this phase. This allows to significantly reduce the data set cardinality. If the query contains LIMIT + OFFSET then CS builds a sorted run of the records that is up to LIMIT+OFFSET size. CS does this step in parallel dividing the whole data set into k runs where k is governed by a session variable - infinidb/columnstore_orderby_threads. At this phase CS tries to preallocate memory in QUEUE_RESERVE_SIZE batches.
CS merges and sorts k presorted partial runs produced by a previous phase in a single thread. If the query contains DISTINCT keyword CS rebuilds a hash map to preserve uniqueness.
We want to make 2nd phase also parallel using range partitioning of the presorted runs produced by the 1st phase. After 1st phase finishes we know the distribution of the sorting key values thus can divide the thread key values run into regions - buckets. Every 2nd phase thread takes values from corresponding region buckets (contains the same values region) from every 1st phase sorted run. Then all 2nd phase threads sorts its runs in parallel. In the end we put the sorted regions in asscending order of the key values into output stream.

### Engine independent statistics for Columnstore

CS now has a very rudimentary query optimization capabilities and we want to improve the situtation. We consider to use Server's optimizer for the purpose but the Server needs statistics namely values distribution histograms and Number of Distinct Values distribution histograms.
There are different levels of complexity for the task:

* implement standalone segment files reader that in the end populates both mysql.column_stats and mysql.table_stats using out of band mariadb client connection
* implement `<code>ANALYZE TABLE</code>` functionality for Columnstore engine
* implement `<code>ANALYZE TABLE</code>` and Histograms with equal-width bins for values distribution histograms(similar to [MDEV-12313](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12313)) together with NDV histograms to decrease I/O

### mcsapi needs a new read API Design

We need an ORM-style NoSQL read API to go along with the bulk write API of mcsapi.
This will likely take the form of:
1. A reader in ExeMgr which will convert messages from mcsapi into jobs
2. Code in mcsapi to send/receive the messages
Although ExeMgr can already receive messages with an execution plan the format is very complex and ABI breaks easily (we often send whole C++ objects).
We should look at other ORM frameworks for inspiration as the the API design.
This task to do the design for this API.

### Use JIT for aggregation functions

CS uses Volcano processing approach working on one value at a time. This is very inefficient way for analytics workload that usually uses lots of aggregation functions in projections, filtering or sorting.
We are interested in using JIT for basic aggregation functions: sum, avg, count, min, max. The patch must compile and run a program that processes and returns the aggregation function result. We were written this description having LLVM in mind as it is widespread and has a lots of examples in the wild.
I suggest to start looking at RowAggregation::addRowGroup() from ./utils/rowgroup/rowaggregation.cpp to get what it takmakees to get avg() function result.

### Histograms: use JSON as on-disk format

Currently, histograms are stored as array of 1-byte bucket bounds (SINGLE_PREC_HB) or or 2-byte bucket bounds (DOUBLE_PREC_HB).
The table storing the histograms supports different histogram formats but limits them to 256 bytes (hist_size is tinyint).

```
CREATE TABLE mysql.column_stats (
  min_value varbinary(255) DEFAULT NULL, 
  max_value varbinary(255) DEFAULT NULL, 
  ...
  hist_size tinyint unsigned, 
  hist_type enum('SINGLE_PREC_HB','DOUBLE_PREC_HB'), 
  histogram varbinary(255), 
  ...
```
This prevents us from supporting other kinds of histograms.
The first low-hanging fruit would be to store the histogram bucket bounds precisely (like MySQL and PostgreSQL do, for example).
The idea of this MDEV is to switch to JSON as storage format for histograms.
