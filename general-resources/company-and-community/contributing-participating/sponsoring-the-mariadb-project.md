# Sponsoring the MariaDB Project

Sponsorships are crucial for ongoing and future development of the MariaDB project! There are a number of easy ways you for you to help the project:

* Fund the development of a specific feature. You can find a list of suggested features to sponsor [here](broken-reference) or in [JIRA](../../training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/general-development-information/tools/jira.md). Feel free to sign in and add more projects to either place!
* Contribute with [developer](contributing-code.md) time. If your organization has talented developers familiar with MariaDB or MySQL codebase they can become part of the MariaDB team and contribute to the development of the MariaDB project.
* Hire a developer that you dedicate to work on the MariaDB project.
* A pure [donation](donate-to-the-foundation.md) with no strings attached

To get going with the sponsorship please visit the [MariaDB Foundation sponsorships page](https://mariadb.org/donate/).
