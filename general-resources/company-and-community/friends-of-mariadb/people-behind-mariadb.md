# People Behind MariaDB

The [MariaDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/compatibility-and-differences/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility) project is the brainchild of Michael
"Monty" Widenius, the founder of MySQLÂ®, Monty Program Ab (now
[MariaDB Corporation](https://mariadb.com)), and a founding member of the
[MariaDB Foundation](https://mariadb.org).


The core team consists of developers sponsored by the MariaDB Foundation,
companies and individuals who are members of the Foundation, and people in
the [MariaDB community](/kb/en/community/).
MariaDB is a technocracy, and we want our core membership to reflect this.


The MariaDB Foundation's role is to be a steward of the MariaDB project. The
Foundation also takes the responsibility of keeping the quality of the MariaDB
project high. The MariaDB Foundation has assumed this stewardship from Monty
Program Ab, which was the original driver until a foundation could be created.


Anyone with enough technical skill level can contribute. You don't have to work at
the MariaDB Foundation, MariaDB Corporation, or at any other Foundation member
company to be able to participate or commit code!


There is an active
[community](resources.md) around MariaDB
that you can be part of. Their developer contributions can be found on the
[log of MariaDB contributors](../contributing-participating/log-of-mariadb-contributions.md).


There have been some questions if MariaDB is a company or a community
open source project. MariaDB is a community open source project because:


* It's driven by a non profit foundation.
* All code in MariaDB is open source. The MariaDB Foundation does not and does
 not intend to release any closed source modules to MariaDB. The same goes for
 companies which are members of the Foundation.
* Anyone can submit pull requests to the MariaDB code base, and ultimately gain commit access.
* Anyone can contribute articles or make changes to the MariaDB Knowledge Base.
* The MariaDB Foundation manages the MariaDB trademark, but gives broad rights to it to others.
