# Database Design Phase 3: Implementation

This article follows on from [Database Design Phase 2: Logical and Physical Design](database-design-phase-2-logical-and-physical-design.md).


The implementation phase is where you install the DBMS on the required hardware, optimize the database to run best on that hardware and software platform, and create the database and load the data. The initial data could be either new data captured directly or existing data imported from a MariaDB database or another DBMS. You also establish database security in this phase and give the various users that you've identified access applicable to their requirements. Finally, you also initiate backup plans in this phase.


The following are steps in the implementation phase:


1. Install the DBMS.
1. Tune the setup variables according to the hardware, software and usage conditions.
1. Create the database and tables.
1. Load the data.
1. Set up the users and security.
1. Implement the backup regime.
