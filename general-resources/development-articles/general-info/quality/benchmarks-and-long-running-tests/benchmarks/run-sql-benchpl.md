# run-sql-bench.pl

`run-sql-bench.pl` is a perl script for automating runs of sql-bench
(You can find sql-bench in the [MariaDB source code](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/server-client-software/download/getting-the-mariadb-source-code).)


`run-sql-bench.pl` can be found in the
[mariadb-tools](mariadb-tools.md) project on Launchpad. Once you have a copy of mariadb-tools,
you'll find the script, and its configuration directories, in the `sql-bench` directory. For the purposes of this
article, wherever you located your local branch of `mariadb-tools` will be called `${BASE_DIR}`.


The `run-sql-bench.pl` script is located at
'`${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/run-sql-bench.pl`'.


Example configuration scripts used for different runs can be found in the various subdirectories of `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/`.


To run the `run-sql-bench.pl` script, do the following:


1. [Branch a MariaDB or MySQL tree](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/server-client-software/download/getting-the-mariadb-source-code)
1. Optionally do some code changes in that tree and commit your changes
1. Edit `run-sql-bench.pl` to set internal options, especially the "`my $path`" variable.
1. Create a `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/conf/host.cnf` file for your system. An
 easy way to do this is by duplicating one of the example `host.cnf` files:
```
cp -avi ${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/conf/pitbull.cnf ${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/conf/${HOSTNAME}.cnf
```
Edit the file to customize it for your system.
1. Create `${HOSTNAME}.cnf` files under the `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/basic`, `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/debug`, `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/debug-full`,
 and `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/O2` directories, depending on which automated
 tests you want to run. Use the example files as a base and customize them for
 your system.
1. Run the `run-sql-bench.pl` script:
```
cd ${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/; ./run-sql-bench.pl --repository=[/path/to/bzr/repository] --sql-bench-options=[additional sql-bench-options] --debug=[yes|no]
```


  * `--repository` is the MariaDB tree to use and compile, the script will also look here for sql-bench.
  * `--sql-bench-options` is mostly used in testing and debugging cases where
 we want to have short run times. For instance, using `--small-test`
 or `--small-table`.
  * You can separate several sql-bench options with spaces like so:
```
--sql-bench-options="--small-test --small-table"
```


## The results


Results are stored at the location specified by the `$sql_bench_results` variable in the `${BASE_DIR}/sql-bench/conf/hostname.cnf` file for your host.
Results are organized in sub directories with the following schema:


```
sql-bench-results-dir/${HOSTNAME}/YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Future plans


* Crash and error detection and reporting.
* One should be able to specify a test name for each file (`run-all-tests` `--suffix='_xxxx'`)
