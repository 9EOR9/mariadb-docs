# Jira - Project Planning and Tracking

Jira is the tool that is used for [bug reporting](../../../community/community/bug-tracking/reporting-bugs.md), project planning and tracking in MariaDB development. It replaced the previous tool called [WorkLog](worklog.md). Jira is also where you can find the [MariaDB roadmap](https://jira.mariadb.org).

The MariaDB Jira is located at [jira.mariadb.org](https://jira.mariadb.org)

Everyone is welcome to sign up for a free account and submit issues, post new tasks or ideas, or to comment on existing issues. The sign up can be found next to the log in boxes on the front page or directly through [this link](https://jira.mariadb.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa).

After filling out the sign up form you can log in.

### Links to Jira Tasks

You can easily create links to Jira tasks in the documentation using their "MDEV" number. For example, the text '`mdev-191`', when entered into the documentation becomes: [MDEV-191](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-191).
