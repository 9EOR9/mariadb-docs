## Possible Causes and Solutions

MariaDB [storage engines](../../../../../community/storage-engines/) differ in many ways, and not all operations are supported by each engine. Perhaps you don't need the intended operation for the engine, or perhaps you need a different storage engine. For example, [sequences](../../../../../community/sql-structure/sequences/) don't support [analyze table](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table), as it's an unnecessary operation on a sequence table, which only contains one row.

```
CREATE SEQUENCE s START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;

ANALYZE TABLE s;

+--------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| test.s | analyze | note     | The storage engine for the table doesn't support analyze |
