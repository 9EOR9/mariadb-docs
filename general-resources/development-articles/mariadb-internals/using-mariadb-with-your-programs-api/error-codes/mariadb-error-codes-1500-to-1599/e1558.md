## Possible Causes and Solutions

### Not upgrading properly

This error likely means an upgrade hasn't been performed properly, as one of the system tables does not match the expected size for the running release. [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-upgrade.md) usually takes care of this. See [Upgrading Between Major MariaDB Versions](../../../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/upgrading/upgrading-between-major-mariadb-versions.md).
