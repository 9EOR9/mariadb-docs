# How Can I Contribute to MariaDB?

There are many ways to contribute to MariaDB. If you want to contribute to, or participate in the development of MariaDB, there are many ways to do so. You don't have to be a developer (but we always welcome more of those), you just have to have the willingness to help make MariaDB better. For example, we are looking for writers or translators of KB articles and people helping setting up MariaDB discussions groups.

[Contributing to the MariaDB Project](../../community/contributing-participating/contributing-to-the-mariadb-project.md) is\
the page that gathers together everything you need to get started.

The [community category](../../../en/community/) contains a lot of interesting links about\
how to participate.

You can also consider [sponsoring a feature](../../community/contributing-participating/sponsoring-the-mariadb-project.md).

Welcome to the [MariaDB community](../../../en/community/)!
