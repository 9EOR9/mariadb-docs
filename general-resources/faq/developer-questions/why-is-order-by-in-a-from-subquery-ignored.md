# Why is ORDER BY in a FROM Subquery Ignored?

Query with ORDER BY in a FROM subquery produces unordered result. Is this a bug?\
Below is an example of this:

```sql
SELECT field1, field2 FROM ( SELECT field1, field2 FROM table1 ORDER BY field2 ) alias
```

returns a result set that is not necessarily ordered by field2. This is not a bug.

A "table" (and subquery in the `FROM` clause too) is - according to the SQL standard - an unordered set of rows. Rows in a table (or in a subquery in the `FROM` clause) do not come in any specific order. That's why the optimizer can ignore the [ORDER BY](../../sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/order-by.md) clause that you have specified. In fact, the SQL standard does not even allow the `ORDER BY` clause to appear in this subquery (we allow it, because `ORDER BY ... LIMIT ...` changes the result, the set of rows, not only their order).

You need to treat the subquery in the `FROM` clause, as a set of rows in some unspecified and undefined order, and put the `ORDER BY` on the top-level `SELECT`.
