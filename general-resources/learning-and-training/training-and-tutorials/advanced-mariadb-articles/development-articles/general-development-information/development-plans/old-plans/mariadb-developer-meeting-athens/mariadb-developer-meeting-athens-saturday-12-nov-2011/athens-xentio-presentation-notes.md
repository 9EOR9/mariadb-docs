Xentio works in the field of Business Intelligence.


Their product is Swarm Cluster (SC)


A Data Warehouse in the TB range costs a lot. SC can do it for a lot less.


SC is a Shared-nothing distributed OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) server. It is optimized for running analytical workloads. It runs on clusters of commodity hardware. Apache Hadoop distributes the workload and MariaDB/MySQL powers node-local processing. It seamlessly integrates with your favorite reporting tool (anything which can process SQL or XML/A).
