**Note:** This page is obsolete. The information is old, outdated, or otherwise currently incorrect. We are keeping the page for historical reasons only. **Do not** rely on the information in this article.



We manage our development plans in Jira. [This search](https://mariadb.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2810.1.0%2C+10.1%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC) shows what we **currently** plan for 10.1. It shows all tasks with the **Fix-Version** being 10.1. Not all these tasks will really end up in 10.1, but tasks with the "red" priorities (![jira-priority-blocker](../../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/plans-for-101/+image/jira-priority-blocker.png "jira-priority-blocker"), ![jira-priority-critical](../../../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/plans-for-101/+image/jira-priority-critical.png "jira-priority-critical"), and ![jira-priority-major](../../../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/plans-for-101/+image/jira-priority-major.png "jira-priority-major")) have a much higher chance of being done in time for 10.1. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that **will** be in 10.1". Tasks with the "green" priorities (![jira-priority-minor](../../../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/plans-for-101/+image/jira-priority-minor.png "jira-priority-minor") and ![jira-priority-trivial](../../../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/plans-for-101/+image/jira-priority-trivial.png "jira-priority-trivial")) probably won't be in 10.1. Think of them as "bonus features that would be **nice to have** in 10.1". Although, as you can see, some of these tasks are already Closed, that is, they are already in 10.1.
