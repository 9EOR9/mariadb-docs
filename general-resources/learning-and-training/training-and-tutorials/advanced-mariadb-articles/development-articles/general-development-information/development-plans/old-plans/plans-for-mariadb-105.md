# Plans for MariaDB 10.5


[MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105) is stable, so no new features will be added. See [Plans for MariaDB 10.6](plans-for-mariadb-106.md) instead.


## JIRA


We manage our development plans in JIRA, so the definitive list will be there. [This search](https://jira.mariadb.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2810.5%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC) shows what we **currently** plan for 10.5. It shows all tasks with the **Fix-Version** being 10.5. Not all these tasks will really end up in 10.5, but tasks with the "red" priorities have a much higher chance of being done in time for 10.5. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that **will** be in 10.5". Tasks with the "green" priorities probably won't be in 10.5. Think of them as "bonus features that would be **nice to have** in 10.5".


## Contributing


If you want to be part of developing any of these features, see [Contributing to the MariaDB Project](../../../../../../../company-and-community/contributing-participating/contributing-to-the-mariadb-project.md). You can also add new features to this list or
to [JIRA](../../../tools/jira.md).
