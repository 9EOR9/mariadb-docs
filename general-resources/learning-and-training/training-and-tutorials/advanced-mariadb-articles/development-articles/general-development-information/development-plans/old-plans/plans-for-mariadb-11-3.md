# Plans for MariaDB 11.3


[MariaDB 11.3](../../../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-113.md) is stable, so no new features will be added. See [Plans for MariaDB 11.5](plans-for-mariadb-11-5.md) instead.


## JIRA


We manage our development plans in JIRA, so the definitive list will be there. [This search](https://jira.mariadb.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2811.3%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC) shows what we **currently** plan for 11.3. It shows all tasks with the **Fix-Version** being 11.3. Not all these tasks will really end up in 11.3 but tasks with the "red" priorities have a much higher chance of being done in time for 11.3. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that **will** be in 11.3". Tasks with the "green" priorities probably won't be in 11.3. Think of them as "bonus features that would be **nice to have** in 11.3".


## Contributing
