# Plans for MariaDB 11.4


[MariaDB 11.4](../../../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-114.md) is an upcoming major development release.


## JIRA


We manage our development plans in JIRA, so the definitive list will be there. [This search](https://jira.mariadb.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2811.4%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC) shows what we **currently** plan for 11.4. It shows all tasks with the **Fix-Version** being 11.4. Not all these tasks will really end up in 11.4 but tasks with the "red" priorities have a much higher chance of being done in time for 11.4. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that **will** be in 11.4". Tasks with the "green" priorities probably won't be in 11.4. Think of them as "bonus features that would be **nice to have** in 11.4".
