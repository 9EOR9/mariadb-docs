# RQG Performance Comparisons

## Performance testing


The `<code>performance/perfrun.pl</code>` executes each query against a set of tw servers
and reports the outcome.


```
perl performance/perfrun.pl --input-directory=... --dsn1=... --dsn2=... --output-file=... --filter=...
```

* `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--input-directory</code>` contains the queries to be run, one query
 per file. Alternative sources for queries will be made available in the
 future;
* `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--dsn1</code>` and `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--dsn2</code>` specify the locations of
 the two servers being compared in the Perl DBI URL format. If the queries are
 not fully qualified, the DSNs must contain the database name. The username
 and the password are also provided via the DSN. For example:


```
--dsn1=dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1:port=19300:user=root:database=test \
--dsn2=dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1:port=19302:user=root:database=test
```

* `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--output-file=...</code>` specifies a file where matching queries
 will be dumped in a form suitable for follow-up filtering with `<code>perfreport</code>`
* if no `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--filter</code>` is specified, all queries from the input will
 be reported;


## Performance reporting


The `<code>performance/perfreport.pl</code>` script takes an ouput file created by
`<code>perfrun</code>` and prints out its contents, possibly applying a filter in the
process:


```
perl performance/perfreport.pl --input-file=... --filter=...
```

If no `<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--filter</code>` is specified, all queries present in the input
file are printed.


## Filters


The queries reported by the system can be filtered out using perl-based
filtering expressions. A filter can be applied during data collection, at which
point it determines what information is stored in the output file and at


If you do not specify a filter, it is assumed that you want to output all
queries.


The following variables can participate in filter expressions:


* Variables from `<code>SHOW SESSION STATUS</code>`, except:

  * variables that are not reset at the start of the query, which
 includes `<code>Com_*</code>`, `<code>Uptime</code>`, `<code>Opened_files</code>` and the like;
  * variables that relate to the operation of SSL encryption or the query cache;
* Variables from `<code>SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_%'</code>`


For each MySQL status variable, 4 Perl variables are provided
â€” the value of the MySQL variable from each server,
their absolute difference and their ratio. For example, for the
`<code>Innodb_rows_read</code>` MySQL variable, you can use `<code>Innodb_rows_read1</code>`,
`<code>Innodb_rows_read2</code>` , `<code>Innodb_rows_read_delta</code>` and
`<code>Innodb_rows_read_ratio</code>` in your Perl filter expressions.


In addition to the MySQL status variables, the framework provides the following
additional variables:


* `<code>$Execution_time{1|2|delta|ratio}</code>` reports the time the query took to run
 from start to end in seconds. The value is truncated at milliseconds in order
 to prevent exorbitant performance ratios from being reported on very fast
 queries;
* `<code>$Temperature</code>` can either be `<code>cold</code>` or `<code>warm</code>` depending on whether the
 first execution of the query is being processed, or the second.
* `<code>$Query</code>` contains the text of the query, in order to enable filtering such
 as `<code>$Query !~ m{l_receiptDATE}</code>`


For example, the following command-line option:


```
--filter='($Execution_time1 > 0.1 || $Execution_time2 > 0.1) && $Temperature eq "warm"'
```

Will only process or report queries that took more than 0.1 sec to execute on a
warm server.


## On-screen Reporting Format


The ASCII on-screen reporting format is as follows:


```
Query: SELECT  l_linenumber FROM lineitem  WHERE l_suppkey  IN ( 10 , 1 ) AND l_shipdate NOT IN ( '1993-06-06' , '1998-02-04' , '1992-01-08' ) AND l_linenumber NOT IN ( 8 , 7 ) AND l_quantity <> 3 AND ( l_orderkey NOT IN ( 1298 , 93 ) OR l_suppkey = 10 ) AND ( l_suppkey BETWEEN 4 AND 10 + 4 OR l_linenumber = 2 AND l_commitDATE BETWEEN '1993-06-27' AND '1993-09-05' AND l_linenumber BETWEEN 3 AND 9 + 9 );
Cache: warm
                                    5.3.0-MariaDB-     5.2.6-MariaDB-          Delta              Ratio
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution time                               0.011s            0.004s           -0.007s            0.36
Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests          2171              1836              -335                 0.85
Handler_read_rnd                           583                 0              -583
Handler_read_next                          583               602                19                 1.03
Innodb_rows_read                          1166               602              -564                 0.52
```

Only variables whose values are different between the two servers are reported.
In this particular example, the query ran slower on `<code>5.3.0-MariaDB</code>` with warm
cache and caused twice as many `<code>Innodb_rows_read</code>`.


## On-disk Data Storage Format


The on-disk storage format is `<code>Data::Dumper</code>` objects, wrapped in
`<code><![CDATA[ ... ]]></code>` tags, without the file being a full-blown XML. The
serialized representation is created by
`<code>GenTest::QueryPerformanceDelta::serialize()</code>` and is read by using `<code>eval()</code>`
in `<code>performance/perfreport.pl</code>`
