**Worklog has been replaced, please refer to [JIRA - project planning and tracking](jira.md) for further information**.


[Worklog](https://askmonty.org/worklog/index.pl) is the tool used to track all
development of [MariaDB](/kb/en/mariadb/).


The MariaDB Worklog is open to everyone at [index.pl](https://askmonty.org/worklog/index.pl)
(a free account on [the developer wiki](https://askmonty.org/wiki) is required
to suggest new tasks and add comments, votes, donations etc.). The account
signup page for the wiki is
[here](https://askmonty.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup).


If you find something in the worklog that you really would like to have done,
you can commit to donate some money to the developer when this is done.
(Search after "Make offer" on the worklog item you would like to sponsor).


If there is something in worklog which you would like to develop, you can
contact us at 'maria-developers (at) lists.launchpad.com' or 'community (at)
askmonty.org'. If you deliver a working solutions that is
[accepted into the MariaDB source tree](https://kb.askmonty.org/v/community-contributing-to-the-mariadb-project#expectations-for-developers),
you will get 60 % of the so far committed money. The rest of the money is kept
by MariaDB Corporation Ab for help managing the project, code reviews, bug fixes,
testing, maintenance, updates and merges to future MariaDB versions.


You can also add a link in the MariaDB worklog to tasks to the
[MySQL worklog](https://forge.mysql.com/worklog/). Just refer to the MySQL task
as #WL<task number>
