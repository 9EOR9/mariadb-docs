# Checking MariaDB

There are a number of ways MariaDB can result in a fault for you as the user. Getting a good clear understanding of the problem is the perfect way to get a good bug report to developers to allow them to fix your problem.


Like the [MariaDB Community Bug Reporting](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/bug-tracking/reporting-bugs) says, start by searching for an existing bug. If its not found, or it not 100% clear that it applies to you, gain some additional information an include those in a new or perhaps and existing bug report.
