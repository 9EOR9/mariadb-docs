# MariaDB Contributor Agreement FAQ


#### What is the Intention of the [MCA](mca.md)?


1. The original copyright holder and the MariaDB Foundation both get (shared) 
 copyright for the code.
1. Both parties can use their copy independently of each other for any purpose
 (as if each copy was completely separate and unique).


#### What if I Don't Want to Submit Code to You Under the [MCA](mca.md)?


If you don't like the [MCA](mca.md) for code that you want to contribute to
[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org), the other option is to submit your code under
the [BSD-new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) license.


#### What is the difference between MCA and BSD-new?


The main difference is that MCA is a **copyright assignment** agreement; you assign the copyright to the MariaDB Foundation (but you retain it too, on your copy of the contribution), while BSD-new is a **license**; you allow the MariaDB Foundation to use your contribution under specific (albeit rather broad) terms.


#### When should I use MCA and when should I use BSD-new?


With MCA, the MariaDB Foundation becomes a copyright holder, and it can defend the GPL
and pursue violators, protecting its and your rights. This is the same reason why the
Free Software Foundation
[requires copyright assignment](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html) too.


On the other hand, BSD-new is a well known FSF-approved Open Source license.


**If you contribute on behalf of your employer**, your employer's legal department is most probably already familiar with the BSD-new license. It might be much easier and faster to get them to approve your
contribution if you contribute under this license.


**If you are an individual contributor** (or if your employer is fine with MCA), it makes sense to contribute under MCA, as it will allow the MariaDB Foundation to defend its Open Source way when needed.


For most other practical purposes there is no difference between these two ways of contributing. You keep the copyright to your contribution. And the MariaDB Foundation will be able to use your contribution in MariaDB Server, relicense it (for example, as GPLv2 or GPLv3) or use separately as a patch.


#### What Will the MariaDB Foundation Do With the Code I Contribute?


The MariaDB Foundation agrees that when it dual licenses code, it will not
restrict the way the third party licensee uses the licensed copy of the code
nor restrict how they use their own code.


#### Where Did the [MCA](mca.md) Come From?


The [MCA](mca.md) is based on 
[Sun's Contributor Agreement](https://www.netbeans.org/about/legal/ca.html). 
We think it is one of the best contributor agreements around!


#### What's the Difference Between Sun's SCA and the [MCA](mca.md)?


Sun's SCA was unclear in a couple of points which we have fixed in the [MCA](mca.md):


* The patent grant has been made clear that it only affects the donated code, 
 not any other code.
* We added a clarification how code is donated; "Each submission must 
 explicitly be marked that it's donated under the MCA"
* We have made a promise in this FAQ how the MariaDB Foundation will
 Dual-license code. See Monty's blog post
 "[Thoughts about Dual-licensing Open Source software](https://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/08/thoughts-about-dual-licensing-open.html)" for a discussion about this.


#### What Happened to the Monty Program Contributor Agreement?


With the establishment of the MariaDB Foundation, Monty Program Ab transferred
all existing signed contributor agreements to the Foundation.
