# MariaDB for Universities Program

The MariaDB for Universities Program is an educational initiative by the MariaDB Foundation aimed at bringing the knowledge and expertise of a world-class open-source database project to universities and their students.


## Offering for Universities


The MariaDB for Universities Program offers benefits to participating universities, including:


* Access to Expertise: Access to the brains behind MariaDB.
* Enhanced Database Curriculum: Up-to-date lecture materials that make database theory practical and engaging.
* Coding Opportunities: Provide students with real-world coding experiences contributing to open-source projects.
* Open-Source Advocacy: Equip students with the skills and values to participate in the global open-source movement.
* Career Readiness: Prepare students for future job opportunities by teaching relevant technologies and participating hands-on in an open-source community.
* Research and Collaboration: Support researchers to use and contribute to the MariaDB ecosystem.


## How We Deliver


* We offer lecture materials.
* Select employees can, on request, visit your institution to lecture.
* We review your contributions to MariaDB in the form of code, documentation, and lecture material.
* Looking for ideas on code contributions? See [](https://jira.mariadb.org/).
* We offer the [MariaDB Jupyter Kernel](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-the-mariadb-jupyter-kernel/) to learn and test MariaDB.

## MariaDB Foundation Goals


The goals for MariaDB Foundation are to drive adoption, openness, and continuity through:


* Graduated students having been taught databases using MariaDB Server.
* Contributions to MariaDB Knowledge Base (the reference manual for MariaDB Server).
* Contributions to MariaDB training materials (used for university lectures).
* Code contributions to MariaDB Server.


## Apply for Participation


MariaDB for Universities Program is open for participation. Please contact us at university@mariadb.org.


The program is currently in Alpha phase, meaning that the first participants will be selected based on individual interactions.


Please email university@mariadb.org and share:


* How are you teaching databases right now? (Number of classes per year, number of students per year.)
* How are you teaching Open Source right now? (Part of which lecture series?)
* What are your goals for database tuition? (Students, researchers, other.)


Based on your email, MariaDB Foundation will contact you for a virtual meeting.
