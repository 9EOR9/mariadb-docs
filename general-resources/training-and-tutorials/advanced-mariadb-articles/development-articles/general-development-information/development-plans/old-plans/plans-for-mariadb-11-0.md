# Plans for MariaDB 11.0


[MariaDB 11.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-0-series/what-is-mariadb-110) is stable, so no new features will be added. See [Plans for MariaDB 11.1](plans-for-mariadb-11-1.md) instead.


## JIRA


We manage our development plans in JIRA, so the definitive list will be there. [This search](https://jira.mariadb.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+MDEV+AND+issuetype+%3D+Task+AND+fixVersion+in+%2811.0%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC) shows what we **currently** plan for 11.0. It shows all tasks with the **Fix-Version** being 11.0. Not all these tasks will really end up in 11.0 but tasks with the "red" priorities have a much higher chance of being done in time for 11.0. Practically, you can think of these tasks as "features that **will** be in 11.0". Tasks with the "green" priorities probably won't be in 11.0. Think of them as "bonus features that would be **nice to have** in 11.0".


## Contributing


If you want to be part of developing any of these features, see [Contributing to the MariaDB Project](../../../../../../company-and-community/contributing-participating/contributing-to-the-mariadb-project.md). You can also add new features to this list or
to [JIRA](../../../tools/jira.md).
