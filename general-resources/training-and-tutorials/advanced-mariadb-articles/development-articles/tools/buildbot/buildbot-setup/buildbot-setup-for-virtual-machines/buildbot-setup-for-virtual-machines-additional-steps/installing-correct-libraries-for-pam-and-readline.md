# Installing correct libraries for PAM and readline

Some additional/alternative libraries needs to be installed to handle readline
and PAM correctly.


The newer libreadline is GPLv3 and so not compatible with the MariaDB/MySQL
GPLv2 license. The PAM libraries are needed for the PAM plugin.


On the Centos and RHEL -build VMs, install the pam-devel package:


```
sudo yum install pam-devel
```

On all the Debian/Ubuntu -build virtual machines, install libpam0g-dev:


```
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

On debian6/maverick/natty, install libreadline5-dev (replacing any
libreadline6-dev already there):


```
sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev
```

On oneiric (and any newer, eg. Debian 7 or Ubuntu 12.04), the package is
called libreadline-gplv2-dev:


```
sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev
```
