# Installing the Boost library needed for the OQGraph storage engine

The OQGraph storage engine needs a newer version of Boost that what is
available on (most) distributions. The version installed is 1.42.0, available
from [](https://www.boost.org/).


The boost library is installed in all the builder virtual machine images with
the following single command:


```
for i in "vm-hardy-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-hardy-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-intrepid-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-intrepid-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-karmic-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-karmic-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-jaunty-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-jaunty-i386-deb-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-lucid-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-lucid-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-maverick-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-maverick-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-natty-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-natty-i386-build qemu64" \
        "vm-oneiric-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-oneiric-i386-build qemu64" \
        "vm-debian5-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-debian5-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-debian4-amd64-build qemu64 --netdev=e1000" "vm-debian4-i386-build qemu32,-nx --netdev=e1000" \
        "vm-centos5-i386-build qemu32,-nx" "vm-centos5-amd64-build qemu64" \
        "vm-hardy-amd64-build qemu64" "vm-hardy-i386-build qemu32,-nx" \
        "vm-jaunty-i386-deb-tarbake qemu32,-nx" ; do \
  set $i; \
  runvm -m 512 --smp=1 --port=2200 --user=buildbot --cpu=$2 $3 $1.qcow2 \
    "= scp -P 2200 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no /kvm/boost_1_42_0.tar.gz buildbot@localhost:/dev/shm/" \
    "sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src /usr/local/include" \
    "cd /usr/local/src && sudo tar zxf /dev/shm/boost_1_42_0.tar.gz" \
    "cd /usr/local/include && sudo ln -s ../src/boost_1_42_0/boost ." ; \
done
```

## Upgrade Boost to 1.49


To upgrade boost on the VMs to 1.49 I performed the following steps:


*I initially tried to upgrade the VMs using a script like the one at the top of the page which was used to install boost 1.42, but I ran into issues with getting it to work on all of the VMs (it worked on some, but not on others). So I ended up using the steps below.*


1. Copy the VM (keeping the original as a backup, in case something goes wrong):
```
oldvm="vm-debian6-i386-build.qcow2"
newvm="vm-debian6-i386-build.upd.qcow2"
cp -avi ${oldvm} ${newvm}
```
1. Start the VM:
```
kvm -m 1024 -hda /kvm/vms/${newvm} -redir 'tcp:22775::22' -boot c -smp 1 -cpu qemu64 -net nic,model=virtio -net user -nographic
```
1. Copy the boost tar.gz file over to the VM:
```
scp -i /kvm/vms/ssh-keys/id_dsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -P 22775 /kvm/boost_1_49_0.tar.gz buildbot@localhost:/dev/shm/
```
1. ssh into the VM:
```
ssh -i /kvm/vms/ssh-keys/id_dsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 22775 buildbot@localhost
```
1. once inside the VM, perform the following steps:
```
cd /usr/local/src
sudo tar zxf /dev/shm/boost_1_49_0.tar.gz 
cd /usr/local/include/
sudo rm boost
sudo ln -s ../src/boost_1_49_0/boost .
sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now
```
