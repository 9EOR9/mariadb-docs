# Fractional DBA Service: CloudDBA

CloudDBA is a "Fractional" DBA Service, a cost-effective solution for businesses that need database administration but do not require a full-time database administrator. This service provides access to a team of experienced database administrators on a part-time basis. Whether it's for routine maintenance, troubleshooting, or strategic advice, CloudDBA's Fractional DBA Service ensures that expert assistance is just a message away. This approach not only saves the expense of a full-time employee but also provides a higher level of service due to the collective knowledge and experience of the CloudDBA team.
