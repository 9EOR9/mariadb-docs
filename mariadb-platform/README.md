# MariaDB Enterprise Platform

### What is MariaDB Enterprise Platform? <a href="#what-is-mariadb-enterprise-platform" id="what-is-mariadb-enterprise-platform"></a>

MariaDB Enterprise Platform is designed to deliver best-in-class performance, data security, replication, clustering, and high availability for production workloads in any cloud environment, including private, public, hybrid, or multicloud setups. It empowers modern data strategies with an end-to-end database solution, ensuring consistent performance and unwavering stability for mission-critical applications in demanding environments. The platform simplifies the data landscape by running all workloads in a single, robust MariaDB environment, powered by open-source technology and fortified with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and support.

#### Components <a href="#components" id="components"></a>

MariaDB Enterprise Platform comprises a number of technology components, modules, tools, and services, notably these include:

* MariaDB Enterprise Server – a scalable database management system offering support for transactional, analytical, and hybrid workloads, working with relational, JSON, and hybrid data models
* MariaDB ColumnStore – a specialized storage engine for scalable, high-performance analytics without the need for complex schemas and indexes – distributed, columnar storage with parallel query processing
* MariaDB MaxScale – a database proxy which provides enterprise high availability, scalability, security and integration services, simplifying application development and database administration
* MariaDB Galera Cluster - a virtually synchronous multi-master cluster, providing read scalability and enhanced transaction security
* MariaDB Connectors – database drivers for practically every programming language

MariaDB Enterprise Platform comprises a number of services, including:

* Remote database administration
* Migration management
* Technical support

#### Security <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

MariaDB Enterprise Platform **includes advanced security features, such as transparent data encryption (TDE), query blocking, result limiting, and a database firewall**, which meet and exceed traditional enterprise security requirements. It also supports dynamic data masking and complete data obfuscation to protect personal data and meet GDPR requirements.

#### Innovation <a href="#innovation" id="innovation"></a>

The platform is **built for the enterprise and accelerated by open-source innovation, offering unmatched performance and compatibility with existing MySQL APIs and commands**. It supports a wide range of database workloads and data types, including transactional, analytical, semi-structured, and AI-ready vector data.

#### MariaDB Enterprise Platform 2025 <a href="#platform-2025-vs.-platform-2026" id="platform-2025-vs.-platform-2026"></a>

In January 2025, Platform 2025 was released. It includes Enterprise Server 11.4 and MaxScale 25.01. Subsequent platform launches will include all the latest new components, such as Enterprise Server 11.8.
