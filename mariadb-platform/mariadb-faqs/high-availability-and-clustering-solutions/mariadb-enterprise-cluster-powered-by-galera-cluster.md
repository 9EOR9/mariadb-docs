# MariaDB Enterprise Cluster (powered by Galera Cluster)

* Q: What is MariaDB Enterprise Cluster and its role in high availability?\
  A: MariaDB Enterprise Cluster is a premier high-availability (HA) database solution offered by MariaDB plc. It leverages Galera Cluster technology to provide synchronous, multi-master replication. This setup ensures data consistency across multiple MariaDB Enterprise Server nodes, delivering excellent fault tolerance and continuous database availability for critical applications.
* Q: How does MariaDB Enterprise Cluster with Galera replication work?\
  A: MariaDB Enterprise Cluster employs Galera replication, which is a virtually synchronous replication method. When a transaction is committed on any node within the cluster, it is immediately replicated to all other member nodes. The transaction is only finalized once all nodes have certified and successfully applied the writeset, enabling any node to be used for both read and write operations reliably.
* Q: What are the main benefits of deploying MariaDB Enterprise Cluster?\
  A: The primary benefits of using MariaDB Enterprise Cluster include robust high availability with automatic failover capabilities, prevention of data loss upon node failure, an active-active multi-master architecture, enhanced read and write scalability across all cluster nodes, and strict data consistency. Enterprise versions often include advanced features like non-blocking Data Definition Language (DDL) operations.
* Q: In what scenarios should I consider using MariaDB Enterprise Cluster?\
  A: MariaDB Enterprise Cluster is ideal for applications that demand continuous uptime, zero tolerance for data loss, and the ability to scale out both read and write operations. Common use cases include e-commerce platforms, financial transaction systems, and any online service requiring robust, uninterrupted high availability.
* Q: Is Galera Cluster technology exclusive to MariaDB Enterprise?\
  A: The core Galera Cluster technology is itself open source and can be utilized with MariaDB Community Server. However, MariaDB Enterprise Cluster represents an integrated solution where Galera is combined with MariaDB Enterprise Server, fully backed by MariaDB plc's professional support, and often bundled with enterprise tools like MariaDB MaxScale for optimized cluster management and performance.
