# MariaDB MaxScale

MariaDB MaxScale is a database proxy that extends the high availability, scalability, and security of MariaDB Server while at the same time simplifying application development by decoupling it from underlying database infrastructure.

MariaDB MaxScale is engineered with an extensible architecture to support plugins, extending its functionality beyond transparent load balancing to become, for example, a database firewall. With built-in plugins for multiple routers, filters and protocols, MariaDB MaxScale can be configured to forward database requests and modify database responses based on business and technical requirements â€” for example, to mask sensitive data or scale reads.
