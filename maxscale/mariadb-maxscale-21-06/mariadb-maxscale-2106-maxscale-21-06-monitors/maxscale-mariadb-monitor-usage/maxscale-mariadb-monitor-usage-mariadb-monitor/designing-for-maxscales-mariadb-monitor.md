# Designing for MaxScale's MariaDB Monitor


# Overview


MaxScale's [MariaDB Monitor (mariadbmon)](../../../../mariadb-maxscale-23-02/mariadb-maxscale-23-02-monitors/mariadb-maxscale-2302-mariadb-monitor.md) monitors [MariaDB replication](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/) deployments.


This page contains topics that need to be considered when designing applications that use the MariaDB Monitor.


* [How does MariaDB Monitor perform automatic failover?](using-automatic-failover-with-maxscales-mariadb-monitor.md)


* [How does the MariaDB Monitor use cooperative locking in a highly available MaxScale deployment?](using-cooperative-locking-for-ha-with-maxscales-mariadb-monitor.md)


Additional information is available [here](../../../../mariadb-maxscale-25/maxscale-25-monitors/mariadb-maxscale-25-mariadb-monitor.md).
