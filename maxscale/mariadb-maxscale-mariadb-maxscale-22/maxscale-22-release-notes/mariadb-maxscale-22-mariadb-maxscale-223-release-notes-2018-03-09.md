# MariaDB MaxScale 2.2.3 Release Notes -- 2018-03-09


Release 2.2.3 is a GA release.


This document describes the changes in release 2.2.3, when compared to
release 2.2.2.


For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report at [Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org).


## Changed Features


### GTID output in MaxCtrl `list servers`


The output of the `list servers` command now has a GTID column. If a server is
being monitored by the mariadbmon monitor, the current GTID position will be
displayed in the newly added column. If no GTID is available, an empty value is
returned.


### MaxAdmin input from scripts


The failure to set terminal attributes for MaxScale is no longer considered an
error as scripts most often do not have an actual terminal that control the
process. This means that passwords and other commands can be passed to MaxAdmin
without a controlling terminal.


### MaxCtrl password input


MaxCtrl can now query the password from the user. This allows passwords to be
given without giving them as process arguments.
