# MariaDB MaxScale Overview

## Overview

MariaDB MaxScale is an advanced proxy, router, and load balancer:

* MaxScale performs automated failover for MariaDB replication. When the primary
  server fails, MaxScale promotes a replica to be the new primary and redirects
  the remaining replicas to it.
* MaxScale's ReadWriteSplit router performs query-based load balancing.
  ReadWriteSplit routes each write statement to the current primary server
  and load balances read statements by routing them to the replica servers.
* MaxScale's ReadConnRoute router performs connection-based load balancing.
  ReadConnRoute routes each connection to a single primary or replica node,
  depending on configuration.
* MaxScale can import data from Kafka and export data into Kafka. MaxScale's
  KafkaCDC router streams data from MariaDB database products to a Kafka broker.
  MaxScale's KafkaImporter router streams data from Kafka to MariaDB database products.
* MaxScale provides built-in mechanisms to perform server maintenance without
  disrupting applications or clients. Servers can be set to maintenance mode
  using the command-line interface with MaxCtrl, a web browser with MaxGUI, or REST API.
* MaxScale's Cache filter can improve SELECT performance by caching and reusing results.
* Security and traffic controls for database connections and queries can be implemented
  with MaxScale. MaxScale's QLAfilter can be used to create an audit trail by logging
  all queries. MaxScale's RegexFilter can also perform audit logging or protect
  against SQL injection by matching queries against a regular expression and
  performing various actions on the query, such as logging it, modifying it, or
  routing it to a specific server.

MariaDB MaxScale can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises.
