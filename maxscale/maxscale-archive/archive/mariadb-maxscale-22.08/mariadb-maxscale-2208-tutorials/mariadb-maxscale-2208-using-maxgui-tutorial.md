### Create a new MaxScale object

Clicking on the _Create New_ button (Annotation 2) to open a dialog for creating\
a new object.

### View Replication Status

The replication status of a server monitored by [MariaDB-Monitor](../mariadb-maxscale-2208-monitors/mariadb-maxscale-2208-mariadb-monitor.md) can be viewed by mousing over\
the server name. A tooltip will be displayed with the following information:\
replication\_state, seconds\_behind\_master, slave\_io\_running, slave\_sql\_running.

## Detail

This page shows information on each MaxScale object and allow to edit its\
parameter, relationships and perform other manipulation operations. Most of the\
control buttons will be shown on the mouseover event. Below is a screenshot of a\
Monitor Detail page, other Detail pages also have a similar layout structure so\
this is used for illustration purpose.

### Annotation

1. Worksheet tab navigation. Each worksheet is bound to a connection, so\
   sessions querying within a worksheet is not yet supported.
2. Add a new worksheet button.
3. Connection manager dropdown. With this dropdown, you can create a new\
   connection or change the connection for the current active worksheet. A new\
   connection can be created by selecting the last option in the dropdown\
   labeled as `New connection`. Once a connection is created, it automatically\
   binds the connection to the current active worksheet.
4. Active database dropdown. Right-click on the database name and click`Use database` option to quickly change the default (current) database
5. Schemas sidebar. Showing available schemas on the current connection. As\
   shown in the figure above, these items can be explored to show tables,\
   stored procedures, columns, and triggers within the schema.
6. Schemas sidebar object.

* Each object has its own context menu providing different options. e.g. For\
  the table object as shown in the figure above, it has options to`Preview Data (top 1000)` and `View Details`. The query result for these\
  options is shown in the `Data Preview` result tab which is annotated as\
  number 12. The context menu can be shown by right-clicking on the object\
  or clicking on the three dots icon placed on the right side of the object.

  overview of the object.

1. Refresh schema objects button. After deleting or creating schema object, the`Schemas sidebar` needs to be manually refreshed.
2. Collapse the `Schemas sidebar` button.
3. SQL editor. The editor is powered by [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) which means its\
   functionalities are similar to VS code. Available commands can be seen by\
   pressing F1 while the cursor is active on the editor. This is an intention\
   to prevent conflict between the browser's shortcut keys and the SQL\
   editor's. This also means the editor shortcut key commands are valid only\
   when the cursor is active on the `SQL editor` with an exception for the`Run all statements`, `Run selected statements` and`Save statements to favorite` commands.
4. Query Results. Showing the query results of queries written in the SQL\
   editor.

   logs The `User query logs` contains logs for queries written in the`SQL editor` while the `Action logs` contains logs for auto-generated SQL,\
   such as `Preview Data (top 1000)`, `View Details`, `Drop Table` and`Truncate Table`.
9. Export query result button. Exporting as `json`, `csv` with a custom\
   delimiter.
10. Filter query result columns dropdown. Selecting columns to be visible.
11. Vertical query result button. Switching to vertical mode.
12. Run button. Running the queries written in the `SQL editor`. Alternatively,\

    scatter, vertical bar, and horizontal bar graph.
14. Create a query snippet from the queries written in the `SQL editor`.\
    Alternatively, press `Ctrl/CMD+D`.
15. Open Script button.
16. Save Script button. This writes content into the opened file. This only\
    works on Chrome or any browsers based on Chromium served over a secure\
    connection (https)
17. Save Script As button. Save the content as a new file.
18. [sql\_select\_limit](https://mariadb.com/docs/reference/mdb/system-variables/sql_select_limit/)\
    input. Changing the maximum number of rows to return from SELECT statements.
19. Add a new session button.
