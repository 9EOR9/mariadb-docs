## Workspace

On this page, you may add numerous worksheets, each of which can be used for either "Run queries" or "Data migration".

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace.png.png)

### Run Queries

Clicking on the "Run Queries" card will pop-up a dialog, providing options\
to establish a connection to different MaxScale object types, including\
"Listener, Server, Service".

The Query Editor worksheet will be rendered in the active worksheet after correctly connecting.

#### Query Editor worksheet

There are various features in the Query Editor worksheet, the most notable ones are listed below.

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace-query-editor.png.png)

**Create a new connection**

If the connection of the Query Editor expires, or if you wish to make\
a new connection for the active worksheet, simply clicking on the button\
located on the right side of the query tabs navigation bar which features a\
server icon and an active connection name as a label. This will open the\
connection dialog and allow you to create a new connection.

**Schemas objects sidebar**

**Set the current database**

There are two ways to set the current database:

* Double-click on the name of the database.
* Right-click on the name of the database to show the context menu, then select\
  the `Use database` option.

**Preview table data of the top 1000 rows**

There are two ways to preview data of a table:

* Click on the name of the table.
* Right-click on the name of the table to show the context menu, then select\
  the `Preview Data (top 1000)` option.

**Describe table**

Right-click on the name of the table to show the context menu, then select the`View Details` option.

**Alter/Drop/Truncate table**

Right-click on the name of the table to show the context menu, then select the\
desired option.

**Quickly insert an object into the editor**

There are two ways to quickly insert an object to the editor:

* Drag the object and drop it in the desire position in the editor.
* Right-click on the object to show the context menu, then mouse\
  hover the `Place to Editor` option and select the desired insert option.

**Editor**

The editor is powered by [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), therefore, its features are similar to those of\
Visual Studio Code.

To see the command palette, press F1 while the cursor is active on the editor.

The editor also comes with various options to assist your querying tasks. To see\
available options, right-click on the editor to show the context menu.

**Re-execute old queries**

Every executed query will be saved in the browser's storage (IndexedDB).\
Query history can be seen in the `History/Snippets` tab.\
To re-execute a query, follow the same step to [insert an object into the editor](mariadb-maxscale-2302-using-maxgui-tutorial.md#quickly-insert-an-object-into-the-editor)\
and click the execute query button in the editor.

**Create query snippet**

Press CTRL/CMD + D to save the current SQL in the editor to the snippets storage.\
A snippet is created with a prefix keyword, so when that keyword is typed in\
the editor, it will be suggested in the "code completion" menu.

### Data Migration

Clicking on the "Data Migration" card will pop-up a dialog, providing an option\
to name the task. The Data Migration worksheet will be rendered in the active\
worksheet after clicking the `Create` button in the dialog.

#### Data Migration worksheet

MaxScale uses ODBC for extracting and loading from the data source to a server\
in MaxScale. Before starting a migration, ensure that you have set up the\
necessary configurations on the MaxScale server. Instruction can be found [here](../mariadb-maxscale-23-02-rest-api/mariadb-maxscale-2302-sql-resource.md#prepare-etl-operation)\
and limitations [here](../mariadb-maxscale-23-02-about/mariadb-maxscale-2302-limitations-and-known-issues-within-mariadb-maxscale.md#etl-limitations).

**Connections**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace-data-migration-set-up-connections.png.png)

Source connection shows the most common parameter inputs for creating\
an ODBC connection. For extra parameters, enable the `Advanced` mode\
to manually edit the `Connection String` input.

After successfully connected to both source and destination servers,\
click on the `Select objects to migrate` to navigate to the next stage.

**Objects Selection**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace-data-migration-objects-selection.png.png)

Select the objects you wish to migrate to the MariaDB server.

After selecting the desired objects, click on the `Prepare Migration Script` to\
navigate to the next stage. The migration scripts will be generated\
differently based on the value selected for the `Create mode` input. Hover over\
the question icon for additional information on the modes.

**Migration**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace-data-migration-migration-script.png.png)

As shown in the screenshot, you can quickly modify the script for each object\
by selecting the corresponding object in the table and using the editors on the\
right-hand side to make any necessary changes.

After clicking the `Start Migration` button, the script for each object will be\
executed in parallel.

**Migration report**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/MaxGUI-workspace-data-migration-migration-report.png.png)

If errors are reported for certain objects, review the output messages and\
adjust the script accordingly. Then, click the `Manage` button and select `Restart`.

To migrate additional objects, click the `Manage` button and select`Migrate other objects`. Doing so will replace the current migration\
report for the current object with a new one.

To retain the report and terminate open connections after migration, click the`Manage` button, then select `Disconnect`, and finally delete the worksheet.

Deleting the worksheet will not delete the migration task. To clean-up\
everything after migration, click the `Manage` button, then select`Delete`.
