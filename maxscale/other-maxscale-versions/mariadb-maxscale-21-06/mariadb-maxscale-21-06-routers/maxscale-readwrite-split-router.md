# MaxScale Read/Write Split Router


# Overview


MariaDB MaxScale is a database proxy that extends the high availability, scalability, and security of MariaDB Server while at the same time simplifying application development by decoupling it from underlying database infrastructure. It includes multiple routers that each support different use cases.
