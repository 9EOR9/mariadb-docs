### Overview

SmartRouter is the query router of the SmartQuery framework. Based on the type\
of the query, each query is routed to the server or cluster that can best\
handle it.

For workloads where both transactional and analytical queries are needed,\
SmartRouter unites the Transactional (OLTP) and Analytical (OLAP) workloads into\
a single entry point in MaxScale. This allows a MaxScale client to freely mix\
transactional and analytical queries using the same connection. This is known\
as Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing, HTAP.

### Configuration

SmartRouter is configured as a service that either routes to other MaxScale\
routers or plain servers. Although one can configure SmartRouter to use a plain\
server directly, we refer to the configured "servers" as clusters.

For details about the standard service parameters, refer to the[Configuration Guide](../maxscale-25-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-25-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide.md).

#### `master`

One of the clusters must be designated as the **`master`**. All writes go to the\
master cluster, which for all practical purposes should be a master-slave\
ReadWriteSplit. This document does not go into details about setting up\
master-slave clusters, but suffice to say, that when setting up the ColumnStore\
servers they should be configured to be slaves of a MariaDB server running an\
InnoDB engine. The ReadWriteSplit [documentation](mariadb-maxscale-25-readwritesplit.md) has more on\
master-slave setup.

#### Service as a Server

Currently the configuration for a router (service) can have a number of servers,\
but not other routers (services). Suppose you have a cluster of servers that are\
managed by ReadWriteSplit. In order for that cluster to be routed-to by\
SmartRouter, the service must be exposed as a server. A server section in the\
configuration file that exposes a service instead of defining an actual server,\
is known as _Service as a Server_.

**Example**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/2.5.29/Documentation/Routers/images/sr-config.png.png)

Suppose we have a service like

```
[RWS-Row]
type=service
router=readwritesplit
```

for which we have defined the listener

```
[RWS-Row-Listener]
type=listener
service=RWS-Row
socket=/tmp/rws-row.sock
```

That is, that service can be accessed using the socket `/tmp/rws-row.sock`.

A server section that would expose that service as a server, looks like this:

```
[RWS-Row-as-a-server]
type=server
socket=/tmp/rws-row.sock
```

Assuming we have defined `RWS-Column`, `RWS-Column-Listener` and`RWS-Column-as-a-server` similarly, we can define the SmartQuery\
service as follows:

```
[SmartQuery]
type = service
router = smartrouter
servers = RWS-Row-as-a-server, RWS-Column-as-a-server
master = RWS-Row-as-a-server
user = <user>
password = <password>

[SmartQuery-Listener]
type = listener
service = SmartQuery
protocol = mariadbclient
port = <port>
```

Note that the SmartQuery listener listens on a port, while the Service as a Server\
listeners listen on a Unix domain socket. The reason is that there is a significant\
performance benefit when SmartRouter accesses the services over a Unix domain socket\
compared to accessing them over a TCP/IP socket.

Note that RWS-Row-as-a-server is designated as the master.

The RWS-Row-as-a-server looks like this:

```
[RWS-Row-Listener]
type = listener
service = RWS-Row
protocol = mariadbclient
socket = /tmp/rws-row.sock

[RWS-Row-as-a-server]
type     = server
socket = /tmp/rws-row.sock
protocol = MariaDBBackend
```

A complete configuration example can be found at the end of this document.

### Cluster selection - how queries are routed

SmartRouter keeps track of the performance, or the execution time, of queries to\
the clusters. Measurements are stored with the canonical of a query as the key.\
The canonical of a query is the sql with all user-defined constants replaced with\
question marks. When SmartRouter sees a read-query whose canonical has not been\
seen before, it will send the query to all clusters. The first response from a\
cluster will designate that cluster as the best one for that canonical. Also,\
when the first response is received, the other queries are cancelled. The\
response is sent to the client once all clusters have responded to the query\
or the cancel.

There is obviously overhead when a new canonical is seen. This means that\
queries after a MaxScale start will be slightly slower than normal. The\
execution time of a query depends on the database engine, and on the contents\
of the tables being queried. As a result, MaxScale will periodically re-measure\
queries.

The performance behavior of queries under dynamic conditions, and their effect\
on different storage engines is being studied at MariaDB. As we learn more, we\
will be able to better categorize queries and move that knowledge into\
SmartRouter.

### Limitations

* `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` is not supported.
* The performance data is not persisted. The measurements have to be performed\
  anew after each startup.
