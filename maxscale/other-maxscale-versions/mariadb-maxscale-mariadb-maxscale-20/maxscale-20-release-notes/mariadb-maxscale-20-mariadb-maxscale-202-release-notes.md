### Updated Features

#### [MXS-978](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-978) Support for stale master in case of restart

In case where replication monitor gets a stale master status (slaves are down)\
and maxscale gets restarted, master loses the stale master status and no writes\
can happen.

To cater for this situation there is now a `set server <name> stale` command.
