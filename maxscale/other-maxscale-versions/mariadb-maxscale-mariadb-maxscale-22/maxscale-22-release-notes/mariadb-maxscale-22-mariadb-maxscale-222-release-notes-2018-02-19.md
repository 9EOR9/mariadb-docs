# MariaDB MaxScale 2.2.2 Release Notes -- 2018-02-19


Release 2.2.2 is a GA release.


This document describes the changes in release 2.2.2, when compared to
release 2.2.1.


For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report at [Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org).


## Changed Features


### MaxCtrl Moved to `maxscale` Package


The MaxCtrl client is now a part of the main MaxScale package, `maxscale`. This
means that the `maxctrl` executable is now immediately available upon the
installation of MaxScale.


In the 2.2.1 beta version MaxCtrl was in its own package. If you have a previous
installation of MaxCtrl, please remove it before upgrading to MaxScale 2.2.2.


### MaxScale C++ CDC Connector Integration


The MaxScale C++ CDC Connector is now distributed as a part of MaxScale. The
connector libraries are in a separate package, `maxscale-cdc-connector`. Refer
to the [CDC Connector documentation](../../mariadb-maxscale-21-06/README.md) for more details.


### Output of `show threads` has changed.


For each thread is shown what state it is in, how many descriptors are currently
in the thread's epoll instance and how many descriptors in total have been in the
thread's epoll instance.


## Dropped Features


## New Features


### Users Refresh Time

the users of service. Please refer to the documentation for
[details](../maxscale-22-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-22-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-usage-scenarios.md#users_refresh_time).


### Local Address


It is now possible to specify what local address MaxScale should
use when connecting to servers. Please refer to the documentation
for [details](../maxscale-22-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-22-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-usage-scenarios.md#local_address).


### External master support for failover/switchover


Failover/switchover now tries to preserve replication from an external master
server. Check
[MariaDB Monitor documentation](../../mariadb-maxscale-21-06/README.md)
for more information.
