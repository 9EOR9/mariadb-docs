# MariaDB MaxScale 2.2.4 Release Notes -- 2018-03-28


Release 2.2.4 is a GA release.


This document describes the changes in release 2.2.4, when compared to
release 2.2.3.


For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug
report at [Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org).


## Changed Features


### Masking is stricter


If a masking rule specifies the table/database in addition to the column
name, then if a resultset does not contain table/database information, it
is considered a match if the column name matches. Please consult the
[documentation](../maxscale-22-filters/mariadb-maxscale-22-masking.md) for details.


## Dropped Features


## New Features


New configuration parameters `retain_last_statements` and
`dump_last_statements` that can be of help when debugging problems. Please
see the [configuration guide](../maxscale-22-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-22-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-usage-scenarios.md)
for details.
