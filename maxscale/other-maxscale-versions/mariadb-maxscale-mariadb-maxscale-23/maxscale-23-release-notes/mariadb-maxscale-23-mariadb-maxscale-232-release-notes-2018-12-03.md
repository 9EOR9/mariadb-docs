# MariaDB MaxScale 2.3.2 Release Notes -- 2018-12-03

Release 2.3.2 is a GA release.

This document describes the changes in release 2.3.2, when compared to the\
previous release in the same series.

For any problems you encounter, please consider submitting a bug\
report on [our Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org/projects/MXS).

### Changed Features

#### Watchdog

The systemd watchdog is now safe to use in all circumstances.

By default it is enabled with a timeout of 60 seconds.

#### Readwritesplit

**`connection_keepalive`**

The default value of `connection_keepalive` is now 300 seconds. This prevents\
the connections from dying due to wait\_timeout with longer sessions. This is\
especially helpful with pooled connections that stay alive for a very long time.

#### MariaDBMonitor

The monitor by default assumes that hostnames used by MaxScale to connect to the backends\
are equal to the ones backends use to connect to each other. Specifically, for the slave\
connections to be properly detected the `Master_Host` and `Master_Port` fields of the\
output to "SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS"-query must match server entries in the MaxScale\
configuration file. If the network configuration is such that this is not the case, the\
setting `assume_unique_hostnames` should be disabled.
