# Galera Monitor

## Overview

The Galera Monitor monitors a Galera cluster. It detects whether nodes are
part of the cluster and if they are in sync with the rest of the cluster.
The monitor also assigns read and write roles to servers, allowing Galera
clusters to be used with modules designed for traditional primary-replica
clusters.

By default, the Galera Monitor will choose the node with the lowest
`wsrep_local_index` value as the primary. This will mean that two MaxScales
running on different servers will choose the same server as the primary.

### WSREP Variables and Their Effects

The following WSREP variables are inspected by Galera Monitor to see whether
a node is usable. If the node is not usable, it loses the `Read` and `Write`
labels and will be in the `Running` state.

* If `wsrep_ready=0`, the WSREP system is not yet ready and the Galera node
  cannot accept queries.

* If `wsrep_desync=1` is set, the node is desynced and is not participating in
  the Galera replication.

* If `wsrep_reject_queries=[ALL|ALL_KILL]` is set, queries are refused and the
  node is unusable.

* With `wsrep_sst_donor_rejects_queries=1`, donor nodes reject
  queries. Galera Monitor treats this the same as if `wsrep_reject_queries=ALL`
  was set.

* If `wsrep_local_state` is not 4 (or 2 with `available_when_donor=true`), the
  node is not in the correct state and is not used.

### Galera clusters and replicas replicating from it

MaxScale 2.4.0 added support for replicas replicating off of Galera nodes. If a
non-Galera server monitored by Galera Monitor is replicating from a Galera node
also monitored by the same monitor, it will be assigned the `Read, Running`
status as long as the replication works. This allows read-scaleout with Galera
servers without increasing the size of the Galera cluster.

## Required Grants

The Galera Monitor requires the `REPLICA MONITOR` grant to work:

```
CREATE USER 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost' IDENTIFIED BY 'maxscale-password';
GRANT REPLICA MONITOR ON *.* TO 'maxscale-user'@'maxscalehost';
```

With MariaDB Server 10.4 and earlier, `REPLICATION CLIENT` is required instead.

```
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'maxscale-user'@'maxscalehost';
```

If `set_donor_nodes` is configured, the `SUPER` grant is required:

```
GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO 'maxscale'@'maxscalehost';
```

## Configuration

A minimal configuration for a Galera Monitor requires a set of servers
and a username and a password to connect to these servers. The user must
have grants as described in the [required grants section](#required-grants).

```
[Galera-Monitor]
type=monitor
module=galeramon
servers=server1,server2,server3
user=myuser
password=mypwd
```

## Common Monitor Settings

For a list of optional parameters that all monitors support, read the
[Common Monitor Parameters](common-monitor-parameters.md) document.

## Settings

### `disable_master_failback`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

If a node marked as primary inside MaxScale happens to fail and the primary
status is assigned to another node MaxScale will normally return the primary
status to the original node after it comes back up. With this option enabled, if
the primary status is assigned to a new node it will not be reassigned to the
original node for as long as the new primary node is running. In this case the
`Master Stickiness` status bit is set which will be visible in the
`maxctrl list servers` output.

### `available_when_donor`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

This option allows Galera nodes to be used normally when they are donors in an
SST operation when the SST method is non-blocking
(e.g. `wsrep_sst_method=mariadb-backup`).

Normally when an SST is performed, both participating nodes lose their `Synced`,
`Write` or `Read` statuses. When this option is enabled, the donor is treated as
if it was a normal member of the cluster (i.e. `wsrep_local_state = 4`). This is
especially useful if the cluster drops down to one node and an SST is required
to increase the cluster size.

The current list of non-blocking SST
methods are `xtrabackup`, `xtrabackup-v2` and `mariadb-backup`. Read the
[wsrep\_sst\_method](../../../galera-cluster/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables.md)
documentation for more details.

### `disable_master_role_setting`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

This disables the assignment of primary and replica roles to the Galera cluster
nodes. If this option is enabled, Synced is the only status assigned by this
monitor.

### `use_priority`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

Enable interaction with server priorities. This will allow the monitor to
deterministically pick the write node for the monitored Galera cluster and will
allow for controlled node replacement.

### `root_node_as_master`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

This option controls whether the write primary Galera node requires
_wsrep\_local\_index_ value of 0. This option was introduced in MaxScale 2.1.0 and
it is disabled by default in versions 2.1.5 and newer. In versions 2.1.4 and
older, the option was enabled by default.

A Galera cluster will always have a node which has a _wsrep\_local\_index_ value
of 0. Based on this information, multiple MaxScale instances can always pick the
same node for writes.

If the `root_node_as_master` option is disabled, the node with the
lowest index will always be chosen as the primary. If it is enabled, only the
node with a _wsrep\_local\_index_ value of 0 can be chosen as the primary.

This parameter can work with `disable_master_failback` but using them together
is not advisable: the intention of `root_node_as_master` is to make sure that
all MaxScale instances that are configured to use the same Galera cluster will
send writes to the same node. If `disable_master_failback` is enabled, this is
no longer true if the Galera cluster reorganizes itself in a way that a
different node gets the node index 0, writes would still be going to the old
node that previously had the node index 0. A restart of one of the MaxScales or
a new MaxScale joining the cluster will cause writes to be sent to the wrong
node, thus resulting in an increasing the rate of deadlock errors and
sub-optimal performance.

### `set_donor_nodes`

* Type: [boolean](../../maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#booleans)
* Default: false
* Dynamic: Yes

This option controls whether the global variable _wsrep\_sst\_donor_ should be set
in each cluster node with `Read` status.
The variable contains a list of replica servers, automatically sorted, with
possible primary candidates at its end.

The sorting is based either on _wsrep\_local\_index_ or node server _priority_
depending on the value of _use\_priority_ option.
If no server has _priority_ defined the sorting switches to _wsrep\_local\_index_.
Node names are collected by fetching the result of the variable _wsrep\_node\_name_.

Example of variable being set in all replica nodes, assuming three nodes:

```
SET GLOBAL wsrep_sst_donor = "galera001,galera000"
```

The monitor user requires the `SUPER` privilege to set the global variable.

## Interaction with Server Priorities

If the `use_priority` option is set and a server is configured with the
`priority=<int>` parameter, the monitor will use that as the basis on which the
primary node is chosen. This requires the `disable_master_role_setting` to be
undefined or disabled. The server with the lowest positive value of _priority_
will be chosen as the primary node when a replacement Galera node is promoted to
a primary server inside MaxScale. If all candidate servers have the same
priority, the order of the servers in the `servers` parameter dictates which is
chosen as the primary.

Nodes with a negative value (_priority_ < 0) will never be chosen as the
primary. This allows you to mark some servers as permanent replicas by assigning a
non-positive value into _priority_. Nodes with the default priority of 0 are
only selected if no nodes with higher priority are present and the normal node
selection rules apply to them (i.e. selection is based on `wsrep_local_index`).

Here is an example.

```
[node-1]
type=server
address=192.168.122.101
port=3306
priority=1

[node-2]
type=server
address=192.168.122.102
port=3306
priority=3

[node-3]
type=server
address=192.168.122.103
port=3306
priority=2

[node-4]
type=server
address=192.168.122.104
port=3306
priority=-1
```

In this example `node-1` is always used as the primary if available. If `node-1`
is not available, then the next node with the highest priority rank is used. In
this case it would be `node-3`. If both `node-1` and `node-3` were down, then`node-2` would be used. Because `node-4` has a value of -1 in _priority_, it
will never be the primary. Nodes without _priority_ parameter are considered as
having a priority of 0 and will be used only if all nodes with a positive
_priority_ value are not available.

With priority ranks you can control the order in which MaxScale chooses the
primary node. This will allow for a controlled failure and replacement of nodes.

### Switchover

Priorities can be used to force a runtime change of the primary server in a
Galera Cluster. For example, if *server1* has a priority of 1 and *server2*
a priority of 2 (with *server1* being primary), the roles can be reversed with
MaxCtrl:
```
maxctrl alter server server1 priority=2
maxctrl alter server server2 priority=1
```

This does not affect the Galera Cluster itself, just the roles MaxScale assigns
to the servers. If multiple MaxScales monitor the same Galera Cluster without
[configuration synchronization](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#configuration-synchronization),
the commands should be run on all MaxScales.

## Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** (added in MaxScale 25.08.0) bootstraps an empty monitor (no
servers), adding servers from an existing Galera cluster. Bootstrap requires
the address of a server in the cluster to start from. The monitor  connects to
the address and reads the *wsrep_incoming_addresses* variable. The monitor
adds the addresses listed as servers to both MaxScale and the monitor.
Server names are auto-generated as in *<monitor_name>-server<num>*,
e.g. *MyGaleraMonitor-server1*.

**Bootstrap** accepts the following key-value arguments:

| argument | type    | default          | description                |
|----------|---------|------------------|----------------------------|
| monitor  | monitor | none (mandatory) | Monitor name               |
| template | server  | empty            | Server settings template   |
| address  | string  | none (mandatory) | Scan starting address      |
| port     | number  | 3306             | Scan starting port         |

Any discovered servers are added to MaxScale as if created via runtime
`maxctrl create server ...`. The servers are thus similar to any other runtime
configured server and are visible in the GUI and `maxctrl list servers`.

The *address* and *port*-settings of the discovered servers are set to the
values listed in *wsrep_incoming_addresses*. Other settings are copied from
the server given in the *template*-setting, so that the discovered servers
inherit e.g. TLS settings. If no server template is given, discovered servers
will use
[server default settings](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#server-1).
The server template must be a valid, existing server in MaxScale configuration.
It need not be monitored by any monitor and its *address* and *port*-settings
can point to a non-existing (but theoretically valid) network address. It can be
configured in the config file or created runtime:
```
maxctrl create server MyServerTemplate address=123.123.123.123 port=1111 ssl=true ssl_ca=/certs/ca.crt
maxctrl call command galeramon bootstrap monitor=MyGaleraMonitor template=MyServerTemplate address=192.168.0.4
```

Bootstrap is incompatible with
[configuration synchronization](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#configuration-synchronization)
and will refuse to run if it is enabled.

## Discover-replicas

**Discover-replicas** (added in MaxScale 25.08.0) is a manual command which adds
any missing Galera servers to MaxScale and the monitor. The servers are
discovered by fetching the value of the *wsrep_incoming_addresses* status
variable (which contains the addresses of all Galera nodes) from the primary
server and comparing it to the values of *wsrep_node_incoming_address* (which
contains just the address of the current node) of already monitored servers. Any
addresses listed in *wsrep_incoming_addresses* but not found in any existing
server are then assumed to be missing servers. The missing servers are then
added to MaxScale configuration and the monitor. The command can also optionally
remove servers that are shut down or not part of the Galera cluster.

**Discover-replicas** accepts the following key-value arguments:

| argument   | type    | default          | description                                 |
|------------|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| monitor    | monitor | none (mandatory) | Monitor name                                |
| remove     | boolean | false            | Remove shut down or non-replicating servers |

Any discovered servers are added to MaxScale as if created via runtime `maxctrl
create server ...`. The servers are thus similar to any other runtime configured
server and are visible in the GUI and `maxctrl list servers`.  The *address* and
*port*-settings of the discovered servers are set to the values listed in
*wsrep_incoming_addresses*.  Other settings are copied from the current primary
server, so that the discovered servers inherit e.g. TLS settings.
Discovered servers are named *<monitor_name>-server<num>*,
e.g. *MyGaleraMonitor-server3*.

A server can only be removed if it is not explicitly used by any other module,
e.g. a service. Thus, this command is best used when services are configured with the
[cluster](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#cluster)-setting as the
services will then automatically match any changes in the set of monitored
servers.

```
maxctrl call command galeramon discover-replicas monitor=MyGaleraMonitor remove=true
```
