# Getting Help With MariaDB

If you can't find help in the [MariaDB documentation](/en/mariadb-documentation/), you can also subscribe to the [mailing lists](/en/where-are-other-users-and-developers-of-mariadb/) or [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com) to communicate with MariaDB users and developers.

There's an active help community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming with SQL and indexing questions, and [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/) for non-programming questions for example tuning/backups/architecture/migration/replication etc. Use the *mariadb* tag so questions are searchable by those that can help you.

If you have a question about a feature that is not properly documented or something that is not working as expected, go to the corresponding [Knowledge Base page](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-release-criteria) and ask your question there.

You can report and check on bugs which apply to MariaDB in [JIRA](https://app.gitbook.com/s/iJPrPCGi329TSR8WIXJW/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/jira).
