# ALTER SEQUENCE

#

# Syntax

```
ALTER SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS] sequence_name
[ INCREMENT [ BY | = ] number ]
[ MINVALUE [=] number | NO MINVALUE | NOMINVALUE ]
[ MAXVALUE [=] number | NO MAXVALUE | NOMAXVALUE ]
[ START [ WITH | = ] number ] [ CACHE [=] number ] [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
[ RESTART [[WITH | =] number]
```

`ALTER SEQUENCE` allows one to change any values for a `SEQUENCE` created with [CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence.md).

The options for `ALTER SEQUENCE` can be given in any order.

#

# Description

`ALTER SEQUENCE` changes the parameters of an existing sequence generator. Any parameters not specifically set in the `ALTER SEQUENCE` command retain their prior settings.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` requires the [ALTER privilege](../sql-statements/account-management-sql-commands/grant.md).

#

## Arguments to `ALTER SEQUENCE`

The following options may be used:

| Option | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Option | Default value | Description |
| INCREMENT | 1 | Increment to use for values. May be negative. |
| MINVALUE | 1 if INCREMENT > 0 and -9223372036854775807 if INCREMENT < 0 | Minimum value for the sequence. |
| MAXVALUE | 9223372036854775806 if INCREMENT > 0 and -1 if INCREMENT < 0 | Max value for sequence. |
| START | MINVALUE if INCREMENT > 0 and MAX_VALUE if INCREMENT< 0 | First value that the sequence will generate. |
| CACHE | 1000 | Number of values that should be cached. 0 if no CACHE. The underlying table will be updated first time a new sequence number is generated and each time the cache runs out. |
| CYCLE | 0 (= NO CYCLE) | 1 if the sequence should start again from MINVALUE

# after it has run out of values. |

| RESTART | START if restart value not is given | If RESTART option is used, NEXT VALUE will return the restart value. |

The optional clause `RESTART [ WITH restart ]` sets the next value for the sequence. This is equivalent to calling the [SETVAL()](sequence-functions/setval.md) function with the `is_used` argument as 0. The specified value will be returned by the next call of nextval. Using `RESTART` with no restart value is
equivalent to supplying the start value that was recorded by
[CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence.md) or last set by `ALTER SEQUENCE START WITH`.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` will not allow you to change the sequence so that it's inconsistent. For example:

```
CREATE SEQUENCE s1;
ALTER SEQUENCE s1 MINVALUE 10;
ERROR 4061 (HY000): Sequence 'test.t1' values are conflicting

ALTER SEQUENCE s1 MINVALUE 10 RESTART 10;
ERROR 4061 (HY000): Sequence 'test.t1' values are conflicting

ALTER SEQUENCE s1 MINVALUE 10 START 10 RESTART 10;
```

#

## INSERT

To allow `SEQUENCE` objects to be backed up by old tools, like [mariadb-dump](../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-dumpslow.md), one can use `SELECT` to read the current state of a `SEQUENCE` object and use an `INSERT` to update the `SEQUENCE` object. `INSERT` is only allowed if all fields are specified:

```
CREATE SEQUENCE s1;
INSERT INTO s1 VALUES(1000,10,2000,1005,1,1000,0,0);
SELECT * FROM s1;

+------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-----------+-------+-------+-------+
| next_value | min_value | max_value | start | increment | cache | cycle | round |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-----------+-------+-------+-------+
| 1000 | 10 | 2000 | 1005 | 1 | 1000 | 0 | 0 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+-------+-----------+-------+-------+-------+

SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE s1;
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Table | Create Table |
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| s1 | CREATE SEQUENCE `s1` start with 1005 minvalue 10 maxvalue 2000 increment by 1 cache 1000 nocycle ENGINE=Aria |
+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#

## Notes

`ALTER SEQUENCE` will instantly affect all future `SEQUENCE` operations. This is in contrast to some other databases where the changes requested by `ALTER SEQUENCE` will not be seen until the sequence cache has run out.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` will take a full table lock of the sequence object during
its (brief) operation. This ensures that `ALTER SEQUENCE` is replicated
correctly. If you only want to set the next sequence value to a
higher value than current, then you should use [SETVAL()](sequence-functions/setval.md)
instead, as this is not blocking.

If you want to change storage engine, sequence comment or rename the sequence, you can use [ALTER TABLE](../sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) for this.
