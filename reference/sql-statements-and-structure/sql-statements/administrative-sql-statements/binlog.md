# Syntax

```
BINLOG 'str'
```

#

# Description

`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the
[mariadb-binlog](../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-binlog/mariadb-binlog-options.md) program as the printable representation of certain events in [binary log](../../../../server-usage/programming-customizing-mariadb/stored-routines/binary-logging-of-stored-routines.md) files. The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded
string that the server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the
corresponding event. This statement requires the [SUPER](../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#super) privilege (<= [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-105-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes)) or the [BINLOG REPLAY](../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#binlog-replay) privilege (>= [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-105-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)).
