# Replication Commands

The terms *master* and *slave* have historically been used in replication, and MariaDB has begun the process of adding *primary* and *replica* synonyms. The old terms will continue to be used to maintain backward compatibility - see [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777) to follow progress on this effort.

A list of replication-related commands. See [replication](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/mariadb-releases/compatibility-differences/replication-compatibility-between-mariadb-and-mysql) for more replication-related information.
