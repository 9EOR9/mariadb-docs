* [Revision #3477](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/10.0/revision/3477)\
  Fri 2012-11-09 18:23:10 +0100
  * [MDEV-3847](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-3847) : MSI installer does not work.
  * Fix bug in bootstrapper.
  * Also, delete innodb log files cafter bootstrapping , to workaround\
    "different log size" Innodb error during the first service start by MSI.\
    This is a temporary measure, in the future innodb will allow handling\
    different file size more gracefully.
* [Revision #3476](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/10.0/revision/3476)\
  Tue 2012-11-06 22:20:13 +0100
  * [MDEV-3839](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-3839) : on Solaris 10, KILLing slave thread has no effect.
  * The reason for the error is missing definition for SIGNAL\_WITH\_IO\_CLOSE on this platform\
    which now needs to always be defined, as in 5.6
  * On Solaris10 only, this preprocessor constant was not defined, thus code\
    that shutdowns a socket in THD::awake was not executed, and polling thread was\
    not interrupted.
  * Fix is to always define SIGNAL\_WITH\_IO\_CLOSE, just like MySQL5.6 does.
* [Revision #3475](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/10.0/revision/3475)\

  * [MDEV-3822](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-3822) :10.0-serg fails on windows buildslaves
  * Fix mismerged code from 5.6 (named-pipe related). viopipe.c, which was\
    introduced in 5.6 is now copied almost identically into 10.0
  * The unused vio::pipe\_overlapped is removed.

Fix for LPBUG#12912171 - ASSERTION FAILED: QUICK->HEAD->READ_SET == SAVE_READ_SET
and
```

* and related fixes from: BUG#1006164, [MDEV-376](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-376):
  * Now, ROR-merged QUICK\_RANGE\_SELECT objects make no assumptions about the values\
    of table->read\_set and table->write\_set.
  * Each QUICK\_ROR\_SELECT has (and had before) its own column bitmap, but now, all\
    QUICK\_ROR\_SELECT's functions that care: reset(), init\_ror\_merged\_scan(), and\
    get\_next() will set table->read\_set when invoked and restore it back to what\
    it was before the call before they return.
  * This allows to avoid the mess when somebody else modifies table->read\_set for\
    some reason.

...
351 active_list_max.prev= trn->prev->next= trn;
352 trid_min_read_from= active_list_min.next->min_read_from;
```

* on 345 gcc stores active\_list\_min.next in %ebx\
  (and trn->min\_read\_from=\[%ebx]->trid)\
  and on 352 it does trid\_min\_read\_from= \[%ebx]->min\_read\_from;\
  BUT active\_list\_min.next was changed on the line 351.\
  gcc doesn't notice it and continues to use the cached value.

      * Implementation of Multi-source replication ([MDEV-253](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-253))
      * Documentation of the feature can be found at:
      * This code is based on code from Taobao, developed by Plinux
      * Other things:
        * Added new commands: START ALL SLAVES, STOP ALL SLAVES and SHOW FULL SLAVE STATUS
        * Almost all usage of 'active\_mi' is deleted.
        * Added parameter to reset\_logs() so that one can specify if new logs should be created.
        * Check wildcard match as early as possible for SHOW STATUS. This makes SHOW STATUS like 'xxx' a lot faster and use less mutex
        * Made max\_relay\_log\_size depending on master connection.
        * Added sys\_vars.default\_master\_connection\_basic to fix a failure in sys\_vars.all\_vars, modified sql\_slave\_skip\_counter\_basic to allow session-level settings
        * Added commands to mysqladmin: start-all-slaves & stop-all-slaves
        * Removed logging of "next log '%s' is currently active | not active"
        * Fixed bug in my\_vsnprintf() when using positional parameters with length
        * Added fn\_ext2(), which returns pointer to last '.' in file name
        * max\_relay\_log\_size now acts as a normal slave specific variable
        * Don't store replication position if innobase\_overwrite\_relay\_log\_info is not set
        * max\_relay\_log\_size copies it's values from max\_binlog\_size at startup
        * [Revision #3427.4.6](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/10.0/revision/3427.4.6)\
          Wed 2012-10-03 01:44:54 +0300
          * Changed SHOW\_FUNC variabels that don't return SHOW\_ARRAY to SHOW\_SIMPLE\_FUNC.
          * This allows us to avoid calculating variables (including those involving mutex) that doesn't match the given\
            wildcard in SHOW STATUS LIKE '...'
          * Removed all references to active\_mi that could cause problems for multi-source replication.
          * Added START|STOP ALL SLAVES
          * Added SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS
        * [Revision #3427.4.5](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/10.0/revision/3427.4.5)\

    * [MDEV-232](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-232): Remove one fsync() from commit phase.
    * Introduce a new storage engine API method commit\_checkpoint\_request().
      * This is used to replace the fsync() at the end of every storage engine\
        commit with a single fsync() when a binlog is rotated.
    * Binlog rotation is now done during group commit instead of being\
      delayed until unlog(), removing some server stall and avoiding an\
      expensive lock/unlock of LOCK\_log inside unlog().

    * [MDEV-181](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-181): XID crash recovery across binlog boundaries
    * Keep track of how many pending XIDs (transactions that are prepared in\
      storage engine and written into binlog, but not yet durably committed\
      on disk in the engine) there are in each binlog.
    * When the count of one binlog drops to zero, write a new binlog checkpoint\
      event, telling which is the oldest binlog with pending XIDs.
    * When doing XA recovery after a crash, check the last binlog checkpoint\
      event, and scan all binlog files from that point onwards for XIDs that\
      must be committed if found in prepared state inside engine.
    * Remove the code in binlog rotation that waits for all prepared XIDs to\
      be committed before writing a new binlog file (this is no longer necessary\
      when recovery can scan multiple binlog files).

    * [MDEV-225](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-225): Replace with dummy events an event that is not understood by a slave to which it should be sent
    * Add function to replace arbitrary event with dummy event.
    * Add code which uses this to fix the bug that enabling row\_annotate events\
      on the master breaks slaves which do not request such events.
    * Add that slaves set a variable @mariadb\_slave\_capability to inform the\
      master in a robust way about which events it can, and cannot, handle.
    * Add tests.

  * [MDEV-3802](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-3802): Millisecond timeout support in non-blocking client library + fix incorrect blocking.
  * After the merge of VIO stuff from MySQL 5.6, there were some bugs left\
    in the non-blocking client library:
    * vio\_io\_wait() was introduced without any support for non-blocking operation,\
      so async queries could turn into sync.
    * Timeouts were changed to milliseconds, but this was not reflected in the\
      non-blocking API, also semantics was changed so signed -1 was used for\
      "no timeout" rather than unsigned 0.
  * Fix by implementing and using my\_io\_wait\_async() in the non-blocking case. And\
    by introducing a new mysql\_get\_timeout\_value\_ms() API function that provides\
    the timeout with millisecond granularity. The old mysql\_get\_timeout\_value()\
    is kept and fixed to work correctly, converting the timeout to whole seconds.
