Generally: MariaDB-5.1.39 Beta is based on MySQL-5.1.39, but has these\
additional changes and bug fixes.

* Includes MySQL 5.1.39 (check[MySQL release notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-39.html)\
  for details of changes since MySQL 5.1.38)
* Includes XtraDB 1.0.3-8 (check[XtraDB release notes](https://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/percona-xtradb:info:xtradb_changelog#release_1.0.3-8)\
  for details of changes since XtraDB 1.0.3-6)
* RPMs for Centos 5 [now available](https://downloads.askmonty.org/).
* Includes [FederatedX](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/federatedx-storage-engine) as replacement for\
  old Federated storage engine.
* Test suite speedups.
* Binary tarballs now build on Ubuntu Hardy, so now depends on glibc 2.7 rather\
  than 2.9 and so should work on more systems.
* Some (still not all) compiler warnings eliminated.
* [Bug #443014](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/443014) Too many 'skipped' messages in mysql-test-run
