      * Fixed recovery bug where bitmap pages would not be correctly updated after\
        processing UNDO rows.
      * Fixed test failures in buildbot
      * Don't write errors when failing to send ok packet
    * [Revision #2891.3.5](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.1-release/revision/2891.3.5)
      * Fixed compiler failures when compiling non debug build
    * [Revision #2891.3.4](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.1-release/revision/2891.3.4) \[merge]

        * [Revision #2891.1.29](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.1-release/revision/2891.1.29)
          * Fixed bug that 'maria\_read\_log -a' didn't set max\_trid when reparing tables.
          * Fixed bug in Aria when replacing short keys with long keys and a key\
            tree both overflow and underflow at same time.
          * Fixed several bugs when generating recovery logs when using RGQ with\
            replacing long keys with short keys and vice versa.
          * Lots of new DBUG\_ASSERT()'s
          * Added more information to recovery log to make it easier to know from\
            where log entry orginated.
          * Introduced MARIA\_PAGE->org\_size that tells what the size of the page was\
            in last log entry. This allows us to find out if all key changes for\
            index page was logged.
          * Small code cleanups:
            * Introduced \_ma\_log\_key\_changes() to log crc of key page changes
            * Added share->max\_index\_block\_size as max size of data one can put in\
              key block (block\_size - KEYPAGE\_CHECKSUM\_SIZE)
          * This will later simplify adding a directory to index pages.
            * Write page number instead of page postition to DBUG log
