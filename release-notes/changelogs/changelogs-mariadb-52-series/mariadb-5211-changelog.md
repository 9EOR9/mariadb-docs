  Fri 2012-03-09 15:37:16 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #930814](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930814).
    * This bug was introduced into [mariadb 5.2](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) in the December 2010 with\
      the patch that added a new engine property: the ability to support\
      virtual columns.
    * As a result of this bug the information from frm files for tables\
      that contained virtual columns did not appear in the information schema\
      tables.
* [Revision #3121](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3121)\
  Fri 2012-03-09 14:28:02 +0200
  * Added test case for [Bug #905782](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/905782) "Assertion `pageno < ((1ULL)` <<\` 40)' failed at ma\_pagecache.c:3438: pagecache\_read or table corruption on INSERT into a ucs2 table"
  * The orignal bug has been fixed earlier
* [Revision #3120](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3120)\
  Fri 2012-03-09 14:06:17 +0200
  * Added ucs2 test moved from maria3.test. ([MDEV-167](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-167))
* [Revision #3119](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3119)\
  Thu 2012-03-08 22:33:01 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #884175](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/884175).
  * If in the where clause of the a query some comparison conditions on the\
    field under a MIN/MAX aggregate function contained constants whose sizes\
    exceeded the size of the field then the query could return a wrong result\
    when the optimizer had chosen to apply the MIN/MAX optimization.
  * With such conditions the MIN/MAX optimization still could be applied, yet\
    it would require a more thorough analysis of the keys built to find\
    the value of MIN/MAX aggregate functions with index look-ups.
  * The current patch just prohibits using the MIN/MAX optimization in this\
    situation.

    * Fixed [Bug #905716](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/905716) "Assertion \`page->size <= share->max\_index\_block\_size'"
    * The issue was that Aria allowed too long keys to be created (so that the internal buffer was not big enough to hold the whole key).
    * Key lengths is now limited to HA\_MAX\_KEY\_LENGTH (1000), as for MyISAM.

      * fixes [Bug #930145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930145)
      * A recent change in the server protocol code broke SSL connection for some client libraries.
      * Protocol documentation\
        ([MySQL\_Internals\_ClientServer\_Protocol](https://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol)) says\
        that initial packet sent by client if client wants SSL, consists of client\
        capability flags only (4 bytes or 2 bytes edependent on protocol\
        versionl). Some clients happen to send more in the initial SSL packet (C\
        client, Python connector), while others (Java, .NET) follow the docs and\
        send only client capability flags.
      * A change that broke Java client was a newly introduced check that frst\
        client packet has 32 or more bytes. This is generally wrong, if client\
        capability flags contains CLIENT\_SSL.
      * Also, fixed the code such that read max client packet size and charset in\
        the first packet prior to SSL handshake. With SSL, clients do not have to\
        send this info, they can only send client flags.
      * This is now fixed such that max packet size and charset are not read prior\
        to SSL handshake, in case of SSL they are read from the "complete" client\
        authentication packet after SSL initialization.

    1. on windows: don't hang when there's no console, that is, \_getch() returns -1.
    2. on windows: \_getch() returns an int, not char.\
       to distinguish between (char)255 and (int)-1
    3. everywhere. isspace(pos\[-1]) == ' ' never worked,\
       isspace() returns a boolean, not a char. the never-worked loop was\
       removed to preserve the existing behavior.

  * Back-ported the test cases for bug #12763207 from mysql-5.6 code line into 5.2
  * Completed the fix for this bug.
  * Note: in 5.3 the affected 'if' statement in Item\_in\_subselect::single\_value\_transformer()\
    starting with the condition (thd->variables.sql\_mode & MODE\_ONLY\_FULL\_GROUP\_BY)\
    should be removed altogether. The change from table.cc is not needed either.
  * This is because in 5.3
    * min/max transformation for subqueries are done at the optimization phase
    * evaluation of the expensive subqueries is done at the execution phase.
  * Added an EXPLAIN EXTENDED to the test case for bug #12329653.

    * A table expression with a natural join or a USING clause is transformed\
      into an equivalent expression with equi-join ON conditions. If a reference\
      to a virtual column happened to occur only in these generated equi-join\
      conditions then it was not erroneously marked in the TABLE::vcol\_set bitmap.
    * This could lead to wrong results for queries containing natural join\
      expressions or USING clauses.

  Tue 2011-12-27 13:19:13 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #904345](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/904345).
  * The MIN/MAX optimizer code from the function opt\_sum\_query erroneously\
    did not take into account conjunctive conditions that did not depend on\
    any table, yet were not identified as constant items. These could be\
    items containing rand() or PS/SP parameters. These items are supposed\
    to be evaluated at the execution phase. That's why if such conditions\
    can be extracted from the WHERE condition the MIN/MAX optimization is\
    not applied as currently it is always done at the optimization phase.
  * (In 5.3 expensive subqueries are also evaluated only at the execution\
    phase. So, if a constant condition with such subquery can be extracted\
    from the WHERE clause the MIN/MAX optimization should not be applied\
    in 5.3.)
  * IF an IN/ALL/SOME predicate with a constant left part is transformed\
    into an EXISTS subquery the resulting subquery should not be considered\
    uncacheable if the right part of the predicate is not uncacheable.
  * Backported the function dbug\_print\_item() from 5.3. The function is used\
    only for debugging.

  * The range optimizer incorrectly chose a loose scan for group by\
    when there is a correlated WHERE condition. This range access\
    method cannot be executed for correlated conditions also with the\
    "range checked for each record" because generally the range access\
    method can change for each outer record. Loose scan destructively\
    changes the query plan and removes the GROUP operation, which will\
    result in wrong query plans if another range access is chosen\
    dynamically.

  * Analysis:
    * The class member QUICK\_GROUP\_MIN\_MAX\_SELECT::seen\_first\_key\
      was not reset between subquery re-executions. Thus each\
      subsequent execution continued from the group that was\
      reached by the previous subquery execution. As a result\
      loose scan reached end of file much earlier, and returned\
      empty result where it shouldn't.
  * Solution:
    * Reset seen\_first\_key before each re-execution of the\
      loose scan.
