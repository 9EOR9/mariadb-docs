  * The CREATE SHOW TABLE command misplaced virtual column specifiers:
    * the AS clause for a virtual column was put before optional

    * old\_password\_plugin is used even in embedded builds
* [Revision #2831](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2831): \[merge]
  * Merge
    * [Revision #2826.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2826.2.1):
  * none Fixed [Bug #607168](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/607168).
  * The command CREATE TABLE AS SELECT erroneously preserved the virtual\
    properties of the virtual fields from the select list.
* [Revision #2830](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2830): \[merge]
  * Merge
  * [Revision #2826.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2826.1.1):
    * Fixed [Bug #607566](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/607566).
    * For queries with order by clauses that employed filesort usage of\
      virtual column references in select lists could trigger assertion\
      failures. It happened because a wrong vcol\_set bitmap was used for\
      filesort. It turned out that filesort required its own vcol\_set bitmap.
    * Made management of the vcol\_set bitmaps similar to the management\
      of the read\_set and write\_set bitmaps.
* [Revision #2829](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2829):
  * Fix for [Bug #588599](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/588599), [MySQL Bug #45377](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45377): ARCHIVE tables aren't discoverable after OPTIMIZE
  * Fix based on code from Stewart Smith
* [Revision #2828](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2828):
  * Fixed compiler and valgrind warnings
* [Revision #2827](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2827):
  * Changed usage statistics to use 64 bit ints instead of 32 for all relevant variables.
  * Fixes [Bug #583314](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/583314) user\_statistics - INT overflow
* [Revision #2826](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2826): \[merge]
  * Merge
  * [Revision #2822.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2822.2.1):
    * Fixed [Bug #604503](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/604503).
    * If the expression for a virtual column of table contained datetime\
      comparison then the execution of the second query that used this\
      virtual column caused a crash. It happened because the execution\
      of the first query that used this virtual column inserted a cached\
      item into the expression tree. The cached tree was allocated in\
      the statement memory while the expression tree was allocated in\
      the table memory.
    * Now the cached items that are inserted into expressions for virtual\
      columns with datetime comparisons are always allocated in the same\
      mem\_root as the expressions for virtual columns. So now the inserted\
      cached items are valid for any queries that use these virtual columns.
* [Revision #2825](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2825): \[merge]
  * Merge with [MariaDB 5.1](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md):
* [Revision #2824](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2824): \[merge]
  * Merge patch for ha\_rnd\_init()
  * [Revision #2822.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2822.1.1):
    * Fix for [Bug #588251](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/588251): doStartTableScan() result not checked.
    * The issue was that we didn't always check result of ha\_rnd\_init() which caused a problem for handlers that returned an error in this code.
      * Changed prototype of ha\_rnd\_init() to ensure that we get a compile warning if result is not checked.
      * Added ha\_rnd\_init\_with\_error() that prints error on failure.
      * Checked all usage of ha\_rnd\_init() and ensure we generate an error message on failures.
      * Changed init\_read\_record() to return 1 on failure.
* [Revision #2823](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2823):
  * Fixed [Bug #603186](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/603186).
  * There were two problems that caused wrong results reported with this bug.
    1. In some cases stored(persistent) virtual columns were not marked\
       in the write\_set and in the vcol\_set bitmaps.
    2. If the list of fields in an insert command was empty then the values of\
       the stored virtual columns were set to default.
  * To fix the first problem the function st\_table::mark\_virtual\_columns\_for\_write\
    was modified. Now the function has a parameter that says whether the virtual\
    columns are to be marked for insert or for update.
  * To fix the second problem a special handling of empty insert lists is\
    added in the function fill\_record().
* [Revision #2822](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2822):
  * Fixed [Bug #603654](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/603654).
  * If a virtual column was used in the ORDER BY clause of a query\
    and some of the columns this virtual column was based upon were\
    not referenced anywhere in the query then the execution of the\
    query could cause an assertion failure.
  * It happened because in this case the bitmap of the columns used\
    for ordering keys was not formed correctly.
* [Revision #2821](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2821):
  * Fixed [Bug #604549](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/604549).
  * There was no error thrown when creating a table with a virtual table\
    computed by an expression returning a row.
  * This caused a crash when inserting into the table.
  * Removed periods at the end of the error messages for virtual columns.
  * Adjusted output in test result files accordingly.
* [Revision #2820](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2820):
  * Initial import of SpinxSE, with fixes for MariaDB.
* [Revision #2819](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2819): \[merge]
  * Automerge [MariaDB 5.1](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md)->5.2.
* [Revision #2818](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2818):
  * Fixed [Bug #601164](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/601164).
  * The functions mysql\_delete and mysql\_update lacked calls of\
    updated\_virtual\_fields(). This caused wrong results for\
    some DELETEs/UPDATEs.
  * Added test cases for this bug.
* [Revision #2817](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2817):
  * Make MariaDB compile with VS 2010
  * Most of the changes are backports from MySQL 5.5. Please note\
    that the 64-bit build fails with VS 2010 and the 32-bit build\
    has problems running mysql-test-run.pl.
  * Added files for compiling with VS 2010 and added them\
    to Makefile.am.
  * ifdef'ed ETIMEDOUT, because it is defined by VS 2010 now
  * Removed not needed /MAP's from cmake files
