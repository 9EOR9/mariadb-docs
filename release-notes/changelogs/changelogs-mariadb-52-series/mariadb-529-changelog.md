    * [Revision #3024.1.2](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3024.1.2)\
      Fri 2011-09-09 19:44:07 +0300
      * Fixed that automatic killing of delayed insert thread (in flush, alter\
        table etc) will not abort auto-repair of MyISAM table.
      * Give more information when finding an error in a MyISAM table.
      * When killing system thread, use KILL\_SYSTEM\_THREAD instead of KILL\_CONNECTION to make it easier to ignore the signal in sensitive context (like auto-repair)
      * Added new kill level: KILL\_SERVER that will in the future to be used to signal killed by shutdown.
      * Add more warnings about killed connections when warning level > 3
    * [Revision #3024.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3024.1.1)\
      Fri 2011-09-02 12:41:20 +0300
      * Fixed [Bug #814238](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/814238) "safe\_mutex issues must be assertions in debug binary"
      * Added `--debug-assert-on-error` variable which, if set, will cause safe\_mutex to assert if it founds an error.
* [Revision #3027](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3027)\
  : Thu 2011-09-08 16:57:46 +0300
  * [Bug #813418](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/813418) fix.
    * The problem was that optimization code did not take into account later feature when instad of NOT before BETWEEN it has negated flag into the Item\_func\_between inherited from Item\_func\_neg\_opt. So optimizer tried process NOT BETWEEN as BETWEEN.
    * The patch just switches off the optimisation for NOT BETWEEN as it was before when NOT function was really used.
* [Revision #3026](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3026)\
  : Mon 2011-09-05 09:29:49 +0300
  * Fix of [Bug #780386](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/780386).
    * ALL subquery should return TRUE if subquery rowa set is empty independently\
      of left part. The problem was that Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) do not\
      call execution of second argument if first is NULL no in this case subquery\
      will not be executed and when Item\_func\_not\_all calls any\_value() of the\
      subquery or aggregation function which report that there was rows. So for\
      NULL < ALL (SELECT...) result was FALSE instead of TRUE.
    * Fix is just swapping of arguments of Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) (with\
      changing the operation if it is needed) so that result will be the same\
      (for examole a < b is equal to b > a). This fix exploit the fact that\
      first argument will be executed in any case.
* [Revision #3025](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3025)\
  : Mon 2011-09-05 08:15:46 +0300
  * Fix pbxt suite to keep the same opti9misation it was before.
* [Revision #3024](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3024)\
  : Fri 2011-09-02 10:11:13 +0300
  * [Bug #823169](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/823169) fix.
    * For ANY subqueries NULLs should be ignored (if there is other values) when finding max min.
    * For ALL subqueries NULLs should be saved if they found.
    * Optimisation for ALL suqbueries if NULL is possible in the SELECT list with max/min aggregate function switched off.
    * Some test changed where NULL is not used but optimization with max/min aggregate function important so NOT NULL added.
* [Revision #3023](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3023)\
  : Fri 2011-09-02 01:22:34 +0300
  * Added logging of all errors from my\_read/my\_write/my\_pread/my\_pwrite/my\_open & my\_malloc to mysqld error log if one sets log-warning to 10 or 11
    * The idea is that my\_global\_flags is ored to the MyFlags parameter for the above functions if the MY\_WME flag is not set.
    * As the my\_global\_flags has ME\_JUST\_INFO (mark error as 'note') and possible ME\_NOREFRESH (write error to log) this will force mysqld to log the not critical error to the log as a note.
* [Revision #3022](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3022)\
  : Thu 2011-09-01 21:18:29 +0300
  * Fixed non critical buffer overflow bug in open\_binary\_frm() that could cause ASSERT
  * Added more printing of errors to myisamchk.
* [Revision #3021](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3021)\
  : Thu 2011-09-01 21:13:09 +0300
  * Added variable ARIA\_CHECKPOINT\_LOG\_ACTIVITY to allow one to specify how often we should do a checkpoint.
  * Added more error printing to log if log\_warnings > 2
  * Give an error if checkpoint record is not correct,
* [Revision #3020](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3020)\
  : Mon 2011-08-29 20:38:21 +0300
  * Added logging of all messages (also system warnings) one gets during a MyISAM recovery or auto-recovery.
