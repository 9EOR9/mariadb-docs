    Sat 2011-01-15 11:14:36 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #698882](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/698882).
    * Made sure that the optimal fields are used by TABLE\_REF objects\
      when building index access keys to joined tables.
    * Fixed a bug in the template function that sorts the elements of\
      a list using the bubble sort algorithm. The bug caused poor\
      performance of the function. Also added an optimization that\
      skips comparison with the most heavy elements that has been\
      already properly placed in the list.
    * Made the comparison of the fields belonging to the same Item\_equal\
      more granular: fields belonging to the same table are also ordered\
      according to some rules.

    * Ported the fix for [Bug #702310](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/702310) / [MySQL Bug #59493](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59493).
    * An assertion failure was triggered for a 6-way join query that used two\
      join buffers.
    * The failure happened because every call of JOIN\_CACHE::join\_matching\_records\
      saved and restored status of all tables that were accessed before the table\
      join\_tab. It must do it only for those of them that follow the last table\
      using a join buffer.

      * 3272 Roy Lyseng 2010-11-01
      * [MySQL Bug #52068](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52068): Optimizer generates invalid semijoin materialization plan
      *
      * When MaterializeScan semijoin strategy was used and there were one\
        or more outer dependent tables before the semijoin tables, the scan\
        over the materialized table was not properly reset for each row of\
        the prefix outer tables.
      *
      * Example: suppose we have a join order:
      *
      * ot1 SJ-Mat-Scan(it2 it3) ot4
      *
      * Notice that this is called a MaterializeScan, even though there is an\
        outer table ahead of the materialized tables. Usually a MaterializeScan\
        has the outer tables after the materialized table, but this is\
        a special (but legal) case with outer dependent tables both before and\
        after the materialized table.
      *
      * For each qualifying row from ot1, a new scan over the materialized\
        table must be set up. The code failed to do that, so all scans after\
        the first one returned zero rows from the materialized table.

* Backport the testcase (the fix itself was included with the subquery optimizations backport)
* [Revision #2876](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2876)\
  Wed 2011-01-12 15:00:10 +0300
  * [Bug #665669](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/665669): Result differences on query re-execution
    * Cause: handler::in\_range\_check\_pushed\_down was not reset when a\
      command would call handler->idx\_cond\_push() without later calling\
      handler->index\_end().
    * Fix: reset the variable in handler->reset(), too (like we do with other\
      Index Condition Pushdown members).

  Sun 2010-12-26 16:31:03 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #694443](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/694443)\
    One of the hash functions employed by the BNLH join algorithm\
    calculates the the value of hash index for key value utilizing\
    every byte of the key buffer. To make this calculation valid\
    one has to ensure that for any key value unused bytes of the\
    buffer are filled with with a certain filler. We choose 0 as\
    a filler for these bytes.
  * Added an optional boolean parameter with\_zerofill to the function\
    key\_copy. If the value of the parameter is TRUE all unused bytes\
    of the key buffer is filled with 0.

    * Fixed [Bug #694092](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/694092)
    * In some cases the function make\_cond\_for\_index() was mistaken\
      when detecting index only pushdown conditions for a table:\
      a pushdown condition that was not index only could be marked\
      as such.
    * It happened because the procedure erroneously used the markers\
      for index only conditions that remained from the calls of\
      this function that extracted the index conditions for other\
      tables.
    * Fixed by erasing index only markers as soon as they are need\
      anymore.

  Tue 2010-12-14 14:08:05 +0200
  * Fix [Bug #685411](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/685411)
    * Analysis:
      * The assert failed because st\_select\_lex::print() was called for subqueries\
        as follows:
      * Item\_subselect::print() ->\
        subselect\_single\_select\_engine::print() -> st\_select\_lex::print()
      * It was Item\_subselect::fix\_fields() that set the thd by calling set\_thd(),\
        so when this print() was called before fix\_fields(), subselect\_engine::thd\
        was NULL.
    * Solution:
      * The patch makes all constructors of all subselect\_engine classes to take\
        a THD parameter. The default subselect\_single\_select\_engine engine is created\
        early during parse time, in the Item\_subselect::init call, so we pass the\
        correct THD object already at this point.

    Fri 2010-11-19 07:38:02 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #675922](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/675922).
    * The bug happened when BKA join algorithm used an incremental buffer\
      and some of the fields over which access keys were constructed
      * were allocated in the previous join buffers
      * were non-nullable
      * belonged to inner tables of outer joins.
    * For such fields an offset to the field value in the record is saved\
      in the postfix of the record, and a zero offset indicates that the value\
      is null. Before the key using the field value is constructed the\
      value is read into the corresponding field of the record buffer and\
      the null bit is set for the field if the offset is 0. However if\
      the field is non-nullable the table->null\_row must be set to 1\
      for null values and to 0 for non-null values to ensure proper reading\
      of the value from the record buffer.

    * Fixed [Bug #660963](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/660963).
    * The condition that was supposed to check whether a join table\
      is an inner table of a nested outer join or semi-join was not\
      quite correct in the code of the function check\_join\_cache\_usage.
    * That's why some queries with nested outer joins triggered\
      an assertion failure.
    * Encapsulated this condition in the new method called\
      JOIN\_TAB::is\_nested\_inner and provided a proper code for it.
    * Also corrected a bug in the code of check\_join\_cache\_usage()\
      that caused a downgrade of not first join buffers of the\
      level 5 and 7 to level 4 and 6 correspondingly.

      conditions from WHERE if the table is some inner table\
      of an outer join..

    * The condition over outer tables extracted from the on expression\
      for a outer join must be ANDed to the condition pushed to the\
      first inner table of this outer join only.
    * Nested outer joins cannot use flat join buffers. So if join\_cache\_level\
      is set to 1 then any join algorithm employing join buffers cannot be used\
      for nested outer joins.

    * The patch that introduced the new enumeration type Match\_flag\
      for the values of match flags in the records put into join buffers\
      missed the necessary modifications in JOIN\_CACHE::set\_match\_flag\_if\_none.
    * This could cause wrong results for outer joins with on expressions\

  * Merge with 5.1-release.
    * Fixed problem with oqgraph and 'make dist'
    * Note that after this merge we have a problem show in join\_outer where we examine too many rows in one specific case (related to [MySQL Bug #57024](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=57024)).

    * Fix [Bug #611622](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/611622)
    * Fix [MySQL Bug #52344](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52344) - Subquery materialization: Assertion if subquery in on-clause of outer join
    * Original fix and comments from Oysten, adjusted for the different\
      subquery optimization in MariaDB.
    * Problem: If tables of an outer join are constant tables,\
      the associated on-clause will be evaluated in the optimization\
      phase. If the on-clause contains a query that is to be\
      executed with subquery materialization, this will not work\
      since the infrastructure for such execution is not yet set up.
    * Solution: Do not evaluate on-clause in optimization phase if\
      is\_expensive() returns true for this clause. This is how the\
      problem is currently avoided for where-clauses. This works\
      because, Item\_in\_subselect::is\_expensive\_processor returns true\
      if query is to be executed with subquery materialization.
    * In addition, after [MWL#89](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=89), in MariaDB if the IN-EXISTS strategy\
      is chosen, the in-to-exists predicates are insterted after\
      join\_read\_const\_table() is called, resulting in evaluation of\
      the subquery without the in-to-exists predicates.

  * Fix [Bug #680058](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/680058)
  * Analysis:
    * The send\_data method of the result sink class used to collect\
      data statistics about materialized subqueries incorrectly assumed\
      that duplicate rows are removed prior to calling send\_data. As\
      a result the collected statistics was wrong, which resulted in\
      an incorrect maximal number of keys in the Ordered\_key buffer.
  * Solution:
    * Try to insert each row into the materialized temp table before\
      collecting statistics, and if the insertion results in a duplicate\
      row, do not count the current row.

      happens for outer joins that have constant tables inside them). The number of\
      0 is not correct (should be 1 because outer join will produce at least a NULL-complemented\
      record) but for now we just make it work with incorrect number.

    * The pushdown condition for the sorted table in a query can be complemented\
      by the conditions from HAVING. This transformation is done in JOIN::exec\
      pretty late after the original pushdown condition have been saved in the\
      field pre\_idx\_push\_select\_cond for the sorted table. So this field must\
      be updated after the inclusion of the condition from HAVING.

  Tue 2010-10-26 14:55:42 +0300
  * Fixed [Bug #601156](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/601156)
  * The cause for this bug is that [MariaDB 5.3](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) still processes derived tables\
    (subqueries in the FROM clause) by fully executing them during the parse\
    phase. This will be remedied by [MWL#106](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=106) once merged into the main 5.3.
  * The assert statement is triggered when MATERIALIZATION is ON for EXPLAIN\
    EXTENDED for derived tables with an IN subquery as follows:
    * mysql\_parse calls JOIN::exec for the derived table as if it is regular\
      execution (not explain).
    * When materialization is ON, this call goes all the way to\
      subselect\_hash\_sj\_engine::exec, which creates a partial match engine\
      because of NULL presence.
    * In order to proceed with normal execution, the hash\_sj engine substitutes\
      itself with the created partial match engine.
    * After the parse phase it turns out that this execution was part of\
      EXPLAIN EXTENDED, which in turn calls\
      Item\_cond::print -> ... -> Item\_subselect::print,\
      which calls engine->print().\
      Since subselect\_hash\_sj\_engine::exec substituted the current\
      Item\_subselect engine with a partial match engine, eventually we call\
      its ::print() method. However the partial match engines are designed only\
      for execution, hence there is no implementation of this print() method.
  * The fix temporarily removes the assert, until this code is merged with[MWL#106](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=106).
