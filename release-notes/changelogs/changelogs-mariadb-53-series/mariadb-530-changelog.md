      * Fix of [Bug #777809](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/777809)
      * There are 2 volatile condition constructions AND/OR constructions and fields(references) when first\
        good supported to be top elements of conditions because it is normal practice\
        (see copy\_andor\_structure for example) fields without any expression in the condition is really rare\
        and mostly useless case however it could lead to problems when optimiser changes/moves them unaware\
        of other variables referring to them. An easy solution of this problem is just to replace single field\
        in a condition with equivalent expression well supported by the server ( -> != 0).

  Thu 2011-07-21 00:43:37 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #813447](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/813447).
  * Do not make substitution of a single-row table if it is an inner\
    table of an outer join with on expression containing an expensive\
    subquery.

  Wed 2011-07-20 21:55:55 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #791761](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/791761).
  * An aggregating query over an empty set of a join of two tables\
    with a rejecting HAVING clause erroneously could return a row.\
    It could happen in the cases when the optimizer made a conclusion\
    that the aggregating set was empty.\
    Wrong results were produced because the server missed initial\
    setting for aggregation functions in the mentioned cases.

    * Fixed [Bug #702301](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/702301).
  * The function matching\_cond should take into account that\
    there may be always false constant conjunctive conditions\
    that has not been evaluated yet,for example, conjunctive\
    conditions with non-correlated subqueries.
* [Revision #3125](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3125)\
  Wed 2011-07-20 16:02:26 -0700
  * Adjusted the results of the pbxt.subselect test after the push\
    of the patch for [Bug #780386](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/780386).
* [Revision #3124](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3124)\
  Wed 2011-07-20 21:48:41 +0300
  * Fix of [Bug #780386](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/780386).
  * ALL subquery should return TRUE if subquery rowa set is empty independently\
    of left part. The problem was that Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) do not\
    call execution of second argument if first is NULL no in this case subquery\
    will not be executed and when Item\_func\_not\_all calls any\_value() of the\
    subquery or aggregation function which report that there was rows. So for\
    NULL < ALL (SELECT...) result was FALSE instead of TRUE.
  * Fix is just swapping of arguments of Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) (with\
    changing the operation if it is needed) so that result will be the same\
    (for examole a < b is equal to b > a). This fix exploit the fact that\
    first argument will be executed in any case.

    Wed 2011-07-20 01:31:40 +0400
    * [Bug #806524](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806524): Assertion \`join->best\_read < 1.7976931348623157e+308 with table\_elimination=on and derived\_merge=on\
      reset\_nj\_counters() used to rely on the fact that join nests have\
      table->table==NULL. This ceased to be true wit new derived table\
      optimizations. Use test for table->nested\_join!=NULL instead.
* [Revision #3121](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3121)\
  Tue 2011-07-19 23:19:10 +0300
  * Fixed [Bug #800696](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800696).
  * The problem was that optimizer removes some outer references (it they are\
    constant for example) and the list of outer items built during prepare phase is\
    not actual during execution phase when we need it as the cache parameters.\
    First solution was use pointer on pointer on outer reference Item and\
    initialize temporary table on demand. This solved most problem except case\
    when optimiser also reduce Item which contains outer references ('OR' in\
    this bug test suite).
  * The solution is to build the list of outer reference items on execution\
    phase (after optimization) on demand (just before temporary table creation)\
    by walking Item tree and finding outer references among Item\_ident\
    (Item\_field/Item\_ref) and Item\_sum items.
  * Removed depends\_on list (because it is not neede any mnore for the cache, in the place where it was used it replaced with upper\_refs).
  * Added processor (collect\_outer\_ref\_processor) and get\_cache\_parameters() methods to collect outer references (or other expression parameters in future).

      * [Bug #803457](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/803457): Wrong result with semijoin + view + outer join in maria-5.3-subqueries-mwl90
        * (This is not a real fix for this bug, even though it makes it to no longer repeat)
        * Semi-join subquery predicates, i.e. ... WHERE outer\_expr IN (SELECT ...) may have null-rejecting properties,\
          may allow to convert outer joins into inner.
        * When convert\_subq\_to\_sj() injected IN-equality into parent's WHERE/ON clause, it didn't call\
          $new\_cond->top\_level\_item(), which would cause null-rejecting properties to be lost.
        * Fixed, now the mentioned outer-to-inner conversion will really take place.

    * Fixed [Bug #793448](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/793448).
    * This bug could lead to wrong result sets for a query over a\
      materialized derived table or view accessed by a multi-component\
      key.
    * It happened because the function get\_next\_field\_for\_derived\_key\
      was supposed to update its argument, and it did not do it.

    * Fixed valgrind problems of the patch for bug 794901.
* [Revision #3115](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3115)\
  Mon 2011-07-18 23:45:38 +0300
  * Fix [Bug #782305](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/782305)
  * Analysis:
    * Both the wrong result and the valgrind warning were a result\
      of incomplete cleanup of the MIN/MAX subquery rewrite. At the\
      first execution of the query, the non-aggregate subquery is\
      transformed into an aggregate MIN/MAX subquery. During the\
      fix\_fields phase of the MIN/MAX function, it sets the property\
      st\_select\_lex::with\_sum\_func to true.
    * The second execution of the query finds this flag to be ON.\
      When optimization reaches the same MIN/MAX subquery\
      transformation, it tests if the subquery is an aggregate or not.\
      Since select\_lex->with\_sum\_func == true from the previous\
      execution, the transformation executes the second branch that\
      handles aggregate subqueries. This substitutes the subquery\
      Item into a Item\_maxmin\_subselect. At the same time elsewhere\
      it is assumed that the subquery Item is of type\
      Item\_allany\_subselect. Ultimately this results in casting the\
      actual object to the wrong class, and calling the wrong\
      any\_value() method from empty\_underlying\_subquery().
  * Solution:
    * Cleanup the st\_select\_lex::with\_sum\_func property in the case\
      when the MIN/MAX transformation was performed for a non-aggregate\
      subquery, so that the transformation can be repeated.

    * Changed the code that processing of multi-updates and multi-deletes\
      with multitable views at the prepare stage.
    * A proper solution would be: never to perform any transformations of views\
      before and at the prepare stage. Yet it would require re-engineering\
      of the code that checks privileges and updatability of views.\
      Ultimately this re-engineering has to be done to provide a clean solution\
      for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements that use views.

    * Fix [Bug #777691](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/777691)
    * Analysis:
      * For some of the re-executions of the correlated subquery the\
        where clause is false. In these cases the execution of the\
        subquery detects that it must generate a NULL row because of\
        implicit grouping. In this case the subquery execution reaches\
        the following code in do\_select():
      * while ((table= li++))\
        mark\_as\_null\_row(table->table);
      * This code marks all rows in the table as complete NULL rows.\
        In the example, when evaluating the field t2.f10 for the second\
        row, all bits of Field::null\_ptr\[0] are set by the previous call\
        to mark\_as\_null\_row(). Then the call to Field::is\_null()\
        returns true, resulting in a NULL for the MAX function.
      * Thus the lines above are not suitable for subquery re-execution\
        because mark\_as\_null\_row() changes the NULL bits of each table\
        field, and there is no logic to restore these fields.

      * Fix [Bug #809266](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/809266)
      * Analysis:
        * This is a bug in [MWL#68](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=68), where it was incorrectly assumed\
          that if there is a match in the only non-null key, then\
          if there is a covering NULL row on all remaining NULL-able\
          columns there is a partial match. However, this is not the case,\
          because even if there is such a null-only sub-row, it is not\
          guaranteed to be part of the matched sub-row. The matched sub-row\
          and the NULL-only sub-row may be parts of different rows.
        * In fact there are two cases:
          * there is a complete row with only NULL values, and
          * all nullable columns contain only NULL values.
        * These two cases were incorrectly mixed up in the class member\
          subselect\_partial\_match\_engine::covering\_null\_row\_width.
      * Solution:
        * The solution is to:
        * split covering\_null\_row\_width into two members:\
          has\_covering\_null\_row, and has\_covering\_null\_columns, and
          * take into account each state during initialization and\
            execution.

        * Fixed [Bug #809245](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/809245)
        * In addition to the bug fix explained below, the patch performs\
          few renames, and adds some comments to avoid similar problems.
        * Analysis:
          * The failed assert was due to a bug in [MWL#68](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=68), where it was\
            incorrectly assumed that the size of the bitmap\
            subselect\_rowid\_merge\_engine::null\_only\_columns should be\
            the same as the size of the array of Ordered\_keys.
          * The bitmap null\_only\_columns contains bits to mark columns\
            that contain only NULLs. Therefore the indexes of the bits\
            to be set in null\_only\_columns are different from the indexes\
            of the Ordered\_keys. If there is a NULL-only column that appears\
            in a table after the last partial match column with Ordered\_key,\
            this NULL-only column would require setting a bit with index\
            bigger than the size of the bitmap null\_only\_columns.
          * Accessing such a bit caused the failed assert.
        * Solution:
          * Upon analysis, it turns out that null\_only\_columns is not needed\
            at all, because we are looking for partial matches, and having\
            such columns guarantees that there is a partial match for any\
            corresponding outer value.
        * Therefore the patch removes subselect\_rowid\_merge\_engine::null\_only\_columns.

    * Port of code for: (part of testcase is in mysql-test/t/subquery\*.test and will be ported separately)
      * [Bug #11766642](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/11766642): crash in Item\_field::register\_field\_in\_read\_map\
        with view
      * (Former [MySQL Bug #59793](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59793))
      * Prior to the refactoring in this patch, Item\_cond\_xor behaved\
        partially as an Item\_cond and partially as an Item\_func. The\
        reasoning behind this was that XOR is currently not optimized\
        (thus should be Item\_func instead of Item\_cond), but it was\
        planned optimize it in the future (thus, made Item\_cond anyway\
        to ease optimization later).
      * Even though Item\_cond inherits from Item\_func, there are\
        differences between these two. One difference is that the\
        arguments are stored differently. Item\_cond stores them in a\
        list while Item\_func store them in an args\[].
      * [MySQL Bug #45221](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45221) was caused by Item\_cond\_xor storing arguments in\
        the list while users of the objects would look for them in\
        args\[]. The fix back then was to store the arguments in both\
        locations.
      * In this bug, Item\_cond\_xor initially gets two Item\_field\
        arguments. These are stored in the list inherited from\
        Item\_cond and in args\[] inherited from Item\_func. During\
        resolution, find\_field\_in\_view() replaces the Item\_fields\
        stored in the list with Item\_direct\_view\_refs, but args\[]\
        still points to the unresolved Item\_fields. This shows that\
        the fix for 45221 was incorrect.
      * The refactoring performed in this patch removes the confusion\
        by making the XOR item an Item\_func period. A neg\_transformer()\
        is also implemented for Item\_func\_xor to improve performance\
        when negating XOR expressions. An XOR is negated by negating\
        one of the operands.

  * Fixed [Bug #806504](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806504).\
    Missing initialization of the bitmap not\_null\_tables\_cache to 0\
    in the function Item\_func::eval\_not\_null\_tables caused this bug.\
    This function is called indirectly from the function\
    SELECT\_LEX::update\_used\_tables after merging mergeable views and\
    derived tables into the main query. The leaf tables of resulting\
    query may change their bitmap numbers after this merge. That's why\
    the not\_null\_tables\_cache bitmaps must be updated. Due to the bug\
    mentioned above the result of the re-evaluation of the\
    not\_null\_tables\_cache turned out to be incorrect in some cases.\
    This could trigger an invalid conversion of outer joins into\
    inner joins leading to invalid query result sets.
  * Also removed an implicit conversion from int to bool in the function\
    SELECT\_LEX::update\_used\_tables.

      The offending query returns a wrong result set because the optimizer\
      erroneously eliminated the where condition evaluated it to TRUE.\
      The cause of this wrong transformation was that the flag maybe\_null\
      for an inner table of the outer join was not set to TRUE after the\
      table had replaced the wrapping view.\
      Now the function SELECT\_LEX::update\_used\_tables resets the value\
      of the maybe\_null flag for each leaf table of the query after all\
      merges of views have been done.

  * Fix [Bug #806943](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806943)
    * Analysis:\
      This bug is yet another incarnation of the generic problem\
      where optimization of the outer query triggers evaluation\
      of a subquery, and this evaluation performs a destructive\
      change to the subquery plan. Specifically a temp table is\
      created for the DISTINCT operation that replaces the\
      original subquery table. Later, select\_describe() attempts\
      to print the table name, however, there is no corresponding\
      TABLE\_LIST object to the internal temp table, so we get a\
      crash. Execution works fine because it is not interested in\
      the corresponding TABLE\_LIST object (or its name).
    * Solution:\
      Similar to other such bugs, block the evaluation of expensive\
      Items in convert\_const\_to\_int().

    * Fix [Bug #802979](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/802979)
    * Analysis:\
      This bug consists of two related problems that are\
      result of too early evaluation of single-row subqueries\
      during the optimization phase of the outer query.
      * Several optimizer code paths try to evaluate single-row\
        subqueries in order to produce a constant and use that\
        constant for further optimzation.
      * When the execution of the subquery peforms destructive\
        changes to the representation of the subquery, and these\
        changes are not anticipated by the subsequent optimization\
        phases of the outer query, we tipically get a crash or\
        failed assert.
      * Specifically, in this bug the inner-most suqbuery with\
        DISTINCT triggers a substitution of the original JOIN\
        object by a single-table JOIN object with a temp table\
        needed to perform the DISTINCT operation (created by\
        JOIN::make\_simple\_join).
      * This substitution breaks EXPLAIN because:\
        a) in the first example JOIN::cleanup no longer can\
        reach the original table of the innermost subquery, and\
        close all indexes, and\
        b) in this second test query, EXPLAIN attempts to print\
        the name of the internal temp table, and crashes because\
        the temp table has no name (NULL pointer instead).
    * Solution:
      * a) fully disable subquery evaluation during optimization\
        in all cases - both for constant propagation and range\
        optimization, and
      * b) change JOIN::join\_free() to perform cleanup irrespective\
        of EXPLAIN or not.

          the Win32 API calls (CreateFile, WriteFile, etc). The Windows HANDLE for the open\
          file is stored in the my\_file\_info struct, along with a flag for append mode\
          (because the Windows API does not support opening files in append mode in all cases)\
          The default max open files has been increased to 16384 and can be increased further\
          by setting `--`max-open-files= during the server start.
        * Noteworthy benefit of this patch is that it removes limits from the table\_cache size -\
          allowing for more simultaneus users

    generating key definitions for the table. It's important as the\
    function can be called twice by the optimizer for a derived table\
    if the query contains a subquery to which the IN-EXIST transformation\
    is applicable.
