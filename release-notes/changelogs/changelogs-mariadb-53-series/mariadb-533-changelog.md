* [Revision #3367](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3367)\
  Tue 2011-12-20 12:13:47 +0400
  * Fix version number: it's 5.3.3
* [Revision #3366](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3366)\
  Tue 2011-12-20 09:57:42 +0400
  * Update mysql-test/suite/pbxt/r/subselect.result for the previous push
* [Revision #3365](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3365)\
  Mon 2011-12-19 23:05:44 +0200
  * Backport of [MySQL Worklog #5953](https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=5953) from MySQL 5.6
  * The patch differs from the original MySQL patch as follows:
    * All test case differences have been reviewed one by one, and\
      care has been taken to restore the original plan so that each\
      test case executes the code path it was designed for.
    * A bug was found and fixed in [MariaDB 5.3](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) in\
      Item\_allany\_subselect::cleanup().
    * ORDER BY is not removed because we are unsure of all effects,\
      and it would prevent enabling ORDER BY ... LIMIT subqueries.
    * ref\_pointer\_array.m\_size is not adjusted because we don't do\
      array bounds checking, and because it looks risky.
  * Original comment by Jorgen Loland:
    * [MySQL Worklog #5953](https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=5953) - Optimize away useless subquery clauses
    * For IN/ALL/ANY/SOME/EXISTS subqueries, the following clauses are\
      meaningless:
      * ORDER BY (since we don't support LIMIT in these subqueries)
      * DISTINCT
      * GROUP BY if there is no HAVING clause and no aggregate\
        functions
    * This WL detects and optimizes away these useless parts of the\
      query during JOIN::prepare()
* [Revision #3364](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3364)\
  Mon 2011-12-19 22:24:10 +0400
  * [Bug #906385](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/906385): EXPLAIN EXTENDED crashes in TABLE\_LIST::print with limited max\_join\_size
    * Take into account that subquery's optimization can fail because of @@max\_join\_size error.
* [Revision #3363](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3363)\
  Mon 2011-12-19 20:58:55 +0400
  * [Bug #904432](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/904432): Wrong result with LEFT JOIN, constant table, semijoin=ON,materialization=ON
    * Correct handling for SJ-Materialization + outer joins (details in the comments in the code)
* [Revision #3362](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3362)\
  Mon 2011-12-19 18:07:19 +0400

* [Revision #3360](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3360)\
  Sun 2011-12-18 23:38:37 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #904832](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/904832).
  * Do not perform index condition pushdown for conditions containing subqueries\
    and stored functions.
* [Revision #3359](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3359)\
  Sun 2011-12-18 19:25:00 +0400
  * Bump version number: now it's 5.3.3 (5.3.2 has been released some time ago)
* [Revision #3358](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3358)\
  Fri 2011-12-16 08:05:14 -0800
  * Adjusted test cases of the suite funcs\_1.
* [Revision #3357](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3357)\
  Fri 2011-12-16 14:19:58 +0400
  * Update test results for previous push
* [Revision #3356](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3356)\
  Fri 2011-12-16 10:21:46 +0400
  * GIS issues fixed.
  * Failures on SUN Solaris. Buggy compiler there required some extra initialization\
    for variables. Then the 02 optimization leads to bugs when values set through the\
    pointer are not always taken into account. Finally, the (long long) / (long)\
    crashes there, the explicit typeconverstion added.\
    Failing innodb\_plunin.innodb\_gis.test fixed.
  * per-file comments:
    * mysql-test/suite/innodb\_plugin/t/innodb\_gis.test
      * GIS issues fixed.
    * sql/gcalc\_slicescan.cc
      * GIS issues fixed.
    * sql/gcalc\_tools.cc
      * GIS issues fixed.

    * [Bug #901506](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/901506): Crash in TABLE\_LIST::print on EXPLAIN EXTENDED
      * Let JTBM optimization code handle the case where the subquery is\
        degenerate and doesn't have a join query plan. Regular materialization\
        would fall back to IN->EXISTS for such cases. Semi-Join materialization\
        does not have such option, instead we introduce and use "constant JTBM\
        join tabs".

  Wed 2011-12-14 02:15:15 +0400
  * [Bug #902632](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/902632): Crash or invalid read at st\_join\_table::cleanup, st\_table::disable\_keyread
    * Do a "more thorough" cleanup of SJ-Materialization join tab in\
      JOIN\_TAB::cleanup. The bug was due to the fact that JOIN\_TAB::cleanup() may\
      be called multiple times for the same tab if the join has grouping.

    Mon 2011-12-12 12:36:46 +0200
  * Fixed [Bug #900375](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/900375)
  * The range optimizer incorrectly chose a loose scan for group by\
    when there is a correlated WHERE condition. This range access\
    method cannot be executed for correlated conditions also with the\
    "range checked for each record" because generally the range access\
    method can change for each outer record. Loose scan destructively\
    changes the query plan and removes the GROUP operation, which will\
    result in wrong query plans if another range access is chosen\
    dynamically.
  * [Revision #2732.46.36](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2732.46.36)\
    Thu 2011-12-08 12:05:52 +0200
  * Fixed [Bug #888456](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/888456)
  * Analysis:
    * The class member QUICK\_GROUP\_MIN\_MAX\_SELECT::seen\_first\_key\
      was not reset between subquery re-executions. Thus each\
      subsequent execution continued from the group that was\
      reached by the previous subquery execution. As a result\
      loose scan reached end of file much earlier, and returned\
      empty result where it shouldn't.
  * Solution:
    * Reset seen\_first\_key before each re-execution of the\
      loose scan.

    Fri 2011-12-02 16:26:43 +0100
    1. add `--plugin-dir` and `--default-auth` to mysqltest.
    2. dialog plugin now always returns mysql->password if non-empty and the first question is of password type
    3. split get\_tty\_password into get\_tty\_password\_buff and strdup.
    4. dialog plugin now uses get\_tty\_password by default
    5. dialog.test
    6. moved small tests of individual plugins into a dedicated suite

    * If the duplicate elimination strategy is used for a semi-join and potentially\
      one of the block-based join algorithms can be employed to join the inner\
      tables of the semi-join then sorting of the head (first non-constant) table\
      for a query with ORDER BY / GROUP BY cannot be used.

      * Fix intermittently failing variables-notembedded test case.
      * After sending packet that is too large, clienrt can get either an error packet with\
        ER\_NET\_PACKET\_TOO\_LARGE, or a socket error. Both cases are valid, since the\
        server does not ensure reply was fully read by client, before shutting down and closing\
        the socket.

      * Fix testcases:
        1. main.merge fails with errno 13 in copy\_file().
        2. The reason for the error is that copy\_file tries to create a file with\
           the same name as recently deleted one, and there is still an open handle\
           for the deleted file.
        3. To fix, use my\_delete\_allow\_opened() for MTR's delete\_file. On Windows,\
           this renames file to unique name prior to deletion, and prevents EACCES\
           errors for files opened with FILE\_SHARE\_DELETE.
        4. innodb\_bug59641
        5. generates warnings, after server was killed and restarted in the test case.
        6. The warnings are about test\_suppression table (needs to be repaired, as it that was written just prior to the crash)
        7. Fixed by using FLUSH TABLES after populating warning suppression table.

  * Fix [Bug #833777](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833777), [Bug #894397](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/894397)
  * Analysis:
    * [Bug #894397](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/894397) was a consequence of a prior incorrect fix of [Bug #833777](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833777)\
      which didn't take into account that even when all tables are\
      constant there may be correlated conditions, and the where clause\
      is not equivalent to the constant conditions.
  * Solution:
    * When there are constant tables only, evaluate only the conditions\
      that reference outer fields, because the constant conditions are\
      already checked, and the where clause doesn't have other conditions\
      than constant ones, and outer referencing ones. The fix for[Bug #894397](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/894397) also fixes [Bug #833777](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833777)

  Mon 2011-11-28 12:42:14 +0200
  * Fixed [Bug #747278](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/747278)
  * The problem was that when we have single row subquery with no rows\
    Item\_cache(es) which represent result row was not null and being\
    requested via element\_index() returned random value.
  * The fix is setting all Item\_cache(es) in NULL before executing the\
    query (reset() method) which guaranty NULL value of whole query\
    or its elements requested in any way if no rows was found.
  * set\_null() method was added to Item\_cache to guaranty correct NULL\
    value in case of reseting the cache.

    * The temporary table created during SJ-materialization\

      sort buffers for this internal temporary table were not\
      cleared by the execution code after each subquery\
      re-execution. This resulted in a memory leak detected\
      by valgrind.
  * Solution:
    * Cleanup the sort buffers for the semijon tables as well.

  * Fix [Bug #893486](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/893486)
  * Analysis:
    * The bug is a result of an incomplete fix for [Bug #869036](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/869036)
    * That fix didn't take into account that there may be a case\
      when ther are no NULLs in the materialized subquery, however\
      all columns without NULLs may not be grouped in the only\
      non-null index. This is the case when the left subquery expression\
      has nullable columns.
  * Solution:
    * The patch handles two missing sub-cases of the case when there are\
      no value (non-null matches) for any outer expression, and there are\
      both NULLs and non-NUll values in the outer reference.
      1. If the materialized subquery contains no NULLs there cannot be a\
         partial match, because there are no NULLs in those columns where\
         the outer reference has no NULLs.
      2. If the materialized subquery contains NULLs, but there exists a\
         column, such that its corresponding outer expression has no NULL,\
         and this column also has no NULL. Then there cannot be a partial\
         match either.

      This could result in wrong answers for some queries with IN subqueries.

  Mon 2011-11-21 18:00:55 +0200
  * Fix [Bug #833777](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833777)
  * Analysis:
    * The optimizer distinguishes two kinds of 'constant' conditions:\
      expensive ones, and non-expensive ones. The non-expensive conditions\
      are evaluated inside make\_join\_select(), and if false, already the\
      optimizer detects empty query results.
    *   In order to avoid arbitrarily expensive optimization, the evaluation of\
        expensive constant conditions is delayed until execution. These conditions\
        are attached to JOIN::exec\_const\_cond and evaluated in the beginning of\
        JOIN::exec. The relevant execution logic is:

        ```c
        JOIN::exec()
         {
         if (! join->exec_const_cond->val_int())
         {
         produce an empty result;
         stop execution
         }
         continue execution
         execute the original WHERE clause (that contains exec_const_cond)
         ...
         }
        ```
* As a result, when an expensive constant condition is\
  TRUE, it is evaluated twice - once through\
  JOIN::exec\_const\_cond, and once through JOIN::cond.\
  When the expensive constant condition is a subquery,\
  predicate, the subquery is evaluated twice. If we have\
  many levels of subqueries, this logic results in a chain\
  of recursive subquery executions that walk a perfect\
  binary tree. The result is that for subquries with depth N,\
  JOIN::exec is executed O(2^N) times.
* Solution:
  * Notice that the second execution of the constant conditions\
    happens inside do\_select(), in the branch:\
    if (join->table\_count == join->const\_tables) { ... }\
    In this case exec\_const\_cond is equivalent to the whole WHERE\
    clause, therefore the WHERE clause has already been checked in\
    the beginnig of JOIN::exec, and has been found to be true.\
    The bug is addressed by not evaluating the WHERE clause if there\
    was exec\_const\_conds, and it was TRUE.

  * Fix [Bug #869036](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/869036)
  * Apart from the fix, the patch also adds few more unrelated test\
    cases for partial matching, and fixes few typos.
  * Analysis:
    * This bug uncovered that partial matching via rowid intersection\
      didn't handle the case when:
      * the left IN argument has some NULLs,
      * there are no non-null value matches, and there is no non-null\
        column,
      * the subquery columns that are not covered with the NULLs in\
        the left IN argument contain at least one row, such that it\
        has NULL values in all columns where the left IN operand has\
        no NULLs.
    * In this case there is a partial match.
    * In addition the analysis of the related code uncovered incorrect\
      handling of few other related cases.
  * Solution:
    * The solution for the bug is to check if there exists a row with\
      NULLs in all columns other than the ones having NULL in the\
      let IN operand.
    * The check is implemented via checking whether the bitmaps that\
      store NULL information in class Ordered\_key have a non-empty\
      intersection for the relevant columns.
    * The intersection itself is implemented via the function\
      bitmap\_exists\_intersection() in my\_bitmap.c.

  * Fix [Bug #889744](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/889744)
  * [MariaDB 5.5](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) merges changes from MySQL 5.5 where all constant\
    expressions are wrapped into an Item\_cache. As a result, constant\
    single-row subqueries were also wrapped in an Item\_cache.\
    When analyzing the where clause for constant expressions that\
    can be evaluated during optimization, subqueries wrapped into\
    an Item\_cache did not appear as expensive, and were therefore\
    evaluated during optimization. Such evaluation is against the\
    current architecture of [MariaDB 5.3](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) where subquries are executed\
    during the execute phase.
  * The patch adds the is\_expensive() predicate to Item\_cache.
  * This makes Item\_cache consistent with other wrapping Item\
    classes that need to look at the properties of the wrapped\
    object.

  * Fix [MySQL Bug #12329653](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=12329653)
    * In MariaDB, when running in ONLY\_FULL\_GROUP\_BY mode,\
      the server produced in incorrect error message that there\
      is an aggregate function without GROUP BY, for artificially\
      created MIN/MAX functions during subquery MIN/MAX optimization.
    * The fix introduces a way to distinguish between artifially\
      created MIN/MAX functions as a result of a rewrite, and normal\
      ones present in the query. The test for ONLY\_FULL\_GROUP\_BY violation\
      now tests in addition if a MIN/MAX function was part of a MIN/MAX\
      subquery rewrite.
    * In order to be able to distinguish these MIN/MAX functions, the\
      patch introduces an additional flag in Item\_in\_subselect::in\_strategy -\
      SUBS\_STRATEGY\_CHOSEN. This flag is set when the optimizer makes its\
      final choice of a subuqery strategy. In order to make the choice\
      consistent, access to Item\_in\_subselect::in\_strategy is provided\
      via new class methods.

  * Fix [Bug #833702](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833702)
  * Analysis:
    * Equality propagation propagated the constant '7' into\
      args\[0] of the Item\_in\_optimizer that stands for the\
      "< ANY" predicate. At the same the min/max subquery\
      rewrite swapped the order of the left and right operands\
      of the "<" predicate, but used Item\_in\_subselect::left\_expr.
    * As a result, when the \<ANY predicate is executed early in the\
      execution phase as a contant condition, instead of a constant\
      right (swapped) argument of the < predicate, there was a field\
      (t3.a). This field had no data, since the whole predicate is\
      considered constant, and it is evaluated before any tables are\
      read. Having junk in the field row buffer produced wrong result
  * Solution:
    * Fix create\_swap to pick the correct Item\_in\_optimizer left\
      argument.

  * [Bug #882994](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/882994): Crash in QUICK\_RANGE\_SELECT::reset with derived\_with\_keys
    * The bug was caused by the following scenario:
      * a quick select is created with get\_quick\_select\_for\_ref. The quick\
        select refers to temporary (derived) table. It saves table->file, which\
        refers to a ha\_heap object.
      * When temp table is populated, ha\_heap reaches max. size and is converted\
        to a ha\_myisam. However, quick->file remains pointing to where ha\_heap\
        was.
      * Attempt to use the quick select causes crash.
        * Fixed by introducing QUICK\_SELECT\_I::replace\_handler(). Note that it will\
          not work for index\_merge quick selects. Which is fine, because these\
          quick selects are never created for derived tables.
