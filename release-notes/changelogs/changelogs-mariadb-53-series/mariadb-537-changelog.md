    * [MDEV-214](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-214) [Bug #967242](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/967242) Wrong result with JOIN, AND in ON condition, multi-part key, GROUP BY, subquery and OR in WHERE
    * The problem was in the code (update\_const\_equal\_items()) which marked\
      index parts constant independently of the place where the equality was used.\
      In the test suite it marked t2\_1.c part constant despite the fact that\
      it connected by OR with other expression.
    * Solution is to mark constant only top equalities connected with AND.

  * [Bug #977021](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/977021) ST\_BUFFER fails with the negative D.
    * Points and lines should disappear if we got negative D.
    * To make it work properly inside the GEOMETRYCOLLECTION,\
      we add the empty operation there.
  * [Bug #986977](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/986977) Assertion \`!cur\_p->event' failed in Gcalc\_scan\_iterator::arrange\_event(int, int).
    * The double->inernal coord conversion produced -0 (minus zero) on some data.
    * That minus-zero produces invalid comparison results when compared agains plus-zero.
    * So we fixed the gcalc\_set\_double() to avoid it.
  * per-file comments:
    * mysql-test/r/gis-precise.result
      * result updated.
    * mysql-test/t/gis-precise.test

    * sql/gcalc\_slicescan.cc
      * [Bug #986977](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/986977). The gcalc\_set\_double fixed to not produce minus-zero.

* [Revision #3508](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3508)\
  Fri 2012-04-27 12:59:17 +0300
  * Fix [Bug #985667](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/985667), [MDEV-229](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-229)
  * Analysis:
    * The reason for the wrong result is the interaction between constant\
      optimization (in this case 1-row table) and subquery optimization.
      * First the outer query is optimized, and 'make\_join\_statistics' finds that\
        table t2 has one row, reads that row, and marks the whole table as constant.\
        This also means that all fields of t2 are constant.
      * Next, we optimize the subquery in the end of the outer 'make\_join\_statistics'.\
        The field 'f2' is considered constant, with value '3'. The subquery predicate\
        is rewritten as the constant TRUE.
      * The outer query execution detects early that the whole query result is empty\
        and calls 'return\_zero\_rows'. Since the query is with implicit grouping, we\
        have to produce one row with special values for the aggregates (depending on\
        each aggregate function), and NULL values for all non-aggregate fields. This\
        function calls 'no\_rows\_in\_result' to set each aggregate function to the\
        default value when it aggregates over an empty result, and then calls\
        'send\_data', which in turn evaluates each Item in the SELECT list.
      * When evaluation reaches the subquery predicate, it executes the subquery\
        with field 'f2' having a constant value '3', and the subquery produces the\
        incorrect result '7'.
  * Solution:
    * Implement Item::no\_rows\_in\_result for all subquery predicates. In order to\
      make this work, it is also needed to make all val\_\* methods of all subquery\
      predicates respect the Item\_subselect::forced\_const flag. Otherwise subqueries\
      are executed anyways, and override the default value set by no\_rows\_in\_result\
      with whatever result is produced from the subquery evaluation.

    * [Bug #983285](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/983285) - incompatibility in frm in case of VIEWs with non-default ALGORITHM option.
    * As part of derived tables redesign, values for VIEW\_ALGORITHM\_MERGE and VIEW\_ALGORITHM\_TMPTABLE have changed from (former values 1 rsp 2 , new values 5 rsp 9).
    * This lead to the problem that views, created with version 5.2 or earlier would not work in all situations (e.g "SHOW CREATE VIEW"), or with mysqldump.
    * The fix is to restore backward compatibility for the from file, and convert algorithm={1,2} in the frm to {5,9} when reading .frm from disk, and store backward compatible values when writing from to disk.
    * Also allow processing correct processing for "invalid" .frms created with [MariaDB 5.3](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md)/5.5 GA releases (where algorithm stored in memory matched the one stored in frm).

      * Additionally, mysql\_install\_db.exe now passes root password to "`mysqld.exe --bootstrap`"
      * in hexadecimal form, to handle potential special chars inside password string literal.
