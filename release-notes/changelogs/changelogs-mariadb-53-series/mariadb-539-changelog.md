  Sat 2012-09-29 22:44:13 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #1058071](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1058071) ([MDEV-564](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-564)).
  * In some rare cases when the value of the system variable join\_buffer\_size\
    was set to a number less than 256 the function JOIN\_CACHE::set\_constants\
    determined the size of an offset in the join buffer equal to 1 though\
    the minimal join buffer required more than 256 bytes. This could cause\
    a crash of the server when records from the join buffer were read.

  * [Revision #2732.57.16](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2732.57.16)\
    Fri 2012-09-14 11:26:01 +0300
    * Fix [Bug #1009187](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1009187), [MDEV-373](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-373), [MySQL Bug #58628](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=58628)
    * Analysis:
      * The queries in question use the \[unique | index]\_subquery execution methods.\
        These methods reuse the ref keys constructed by create\_ref\_for\_key(). The\
        way create\_ref\_for\_key() works is that it doesn't store in ref.key\_copy\[]\
        store\_key elements that represent constants. In particular it doesn't store\
        the store\_key for NULL constants.
      * The execution of \[unique | index]\_subquery calls\
        subselect\_uniquesubquery\_engine::copy\_ref\_key, which in addition to copy\
        the left IN argument into a index lookup key, is supposed to detect if\
        the left IN argument contains NULLs. Since the store\_key for the NULL\
        constant is not copied into the key array, the null is not detected, and\
        execution erroneously proceeds as if it should look for a complete match.
    * Solution:
      * The solution (unlike MySQL) is to reuse already computed information about\
        NULL presence. Item\_in\_optimizer::val\_int already finds out if the left IN\
        operand contains NULLs. The fix propagates this to the execution methods\
        subselect\_\[unique | index]subquery\_engine::exec so it knows if there were\
        NULL values independent of the presence of keys.
      * In addition the patch siplifies copy\_ref\_key() and the logic that hanldes\
        the case of NULLs in the left IN operand.

  Fri 2012-09-07 09:39:51 +0300
  * Fix of [MDEV-511](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-511).

  * compilation warning
* [Revision #3571](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3571)\
  Thu 2012-08-30 10:53:49 +0200
  * [MDEV-381](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-381): fdatasync() does not correctly flush growing binlog file.
  * When we append data to the binlog file, we use fdatasync() to ensure\
    the data gets to disk so that crash recovery can work.
  * Unfortunately there seems to be a bug in ext3/ext4 on linux, so that\
    fdatasync() does not correctly sync all data when the size of a file\
    is increased. This causes crash recovery to not work correctly (it\
    loses transactions from the binlog).
  * As a work-around, use fsync() for the binlog, not fdatasync(). Since\
    we are increasing the file size, (correct) fdatasync() will most\
    likely not be faster than fsync() on any file system, and fsync()\
    does work correctly on ext3/ext4. This avoids the need to try to\
    detect if we are running on buggy ext3/ext4.

  * [MDEV-438](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-438) Microseconds: Precision is ignored in CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP(N) when it is given as a default column value
  * The syntax for specifying precision in the DEFAULT clause is unintentional and unsupported.

  Wed 2012-08-29 17:55:59 +0200
  * [MDEV-454](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-454) Addition of a time interval reduces the resulting value
    1. Field\_newdate::get\_date should refuse to return a date with zeros when\
       TIME\_NO\_ZERO\_IN\_DATE is set, not when TIME\_FUZZY\_DATE is unset
    2. Item\_func\_to\_days and Item\_date\_add\_interval can only work with valid dates,\
       no zeros allowed.

    * fix Item\_func\_add\_time::get\_date() to generate valid dates.
    * Move the validity check inside get\_date\_from\_daynr()\
      instead of relying on callers
