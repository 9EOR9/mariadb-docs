    * [Bug #965872](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/965872): Server crashes in embedding\_sjm on a simple 1-table select with AND and OR
      * This is a regession introduced by fix for [Bug #951937](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/951937)
      * The problem was that there were scenarios where check\_simple\_equality() would create an\
        Item\_equal object but would not call item\_equal->set\_context\_field() on it.
      * The fix was to add the missing calls.

      * [Bug #951283](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/951283): Wrong result (missing rows) with semijoin+firstmatch, IN/ANY subquery
        * The problem was with execution strategy for cases where FirstMatch's inner tables\
          were interleaved with outer-uncorrelated tables.
        * I was unable to find any cases where such join orders would be practically useful,\
          so fixed it by disabling them.

    * [Bug #962667](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/962667): Assertion \`0' failed in QUICK\_INDEX\_SORT\_SELECT::need\_sorted\_output()
    * The problem was that
      * we've picked a LooseScan that used full index scan (tab->type==JT\_ALL) on certain index.
      * there was also a quick select (tab->quick!=NULL), that used other indexes.
      * some old code assumes that (tab->type==JT\_ALL && tab->quick) -> means that the\
        quick select should be used, which is not true.
    * Fixed by discarding the quick select as soon as we know we're using LooseScan\
      without using the quick select.

      * Innodb : fix UT\_RELAX\_CPU to be defined as YieldProcessor, as was also originally intended\
        (but intention was lost in the #ifdef maze

      * If the first component of a ref key happened to be a constant appeared\
        after constant row substitution then no store\_key element should be\
        created for such a component. Yet create\_ref\_for\_key() erroneously could\
        create such an element that caused construction of invalid ref keys and\
        wrong results for some joins.

      * [Bug #952372](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/952372): Server crashes on 2nd execution of PS in find\_field\_in\_tables with semijoin+materialization
        * The problem was that convert\_subq\_to\_jtbm() attached the semi-join\
          TABLE\_LIST object into the wrong list: they used to attach it to the\
          end of parent\_lex->leaf\_tables.head()->next\_local->...->next\_local.\
          This was apparently inccorect, as one can construct an example where\
          JTBM nest is attached to a table that is inside some mergeable VIEW, which\
          breaks (causes crash) for name resolution on the subsequent statement\
          re-execution.
        * Solution: Attach to the "right" list. The "wording" was copied from\
          st\_select\_lex::handle\_derived.

  * Make Replication filter settings dynamic.
  * Make the slave options `--replicate-*` dynamic variables so that these\
    options can be changed dynamically while the server is running,\
    which enables users to modify replication filtering rules without\
    having to stop and restart the server.
  * This is accomplished by just requiring that the slave threads are\
    stopped when these options are set dynamically. Since filtering\
    rules are only used by the SQL slave thread, setting them while the\
    thread is not running avoids the need for locking.

    * Don't use SAFEMALLOC on valgrind builds (slows things down)
    * Added back lost option from 5.3: debug-mutex-deadlock-detector
    * Flush pages before taking lock mutex (speeds up closing of Aria tables).

        * Fixed LP bug #930814.
        * This bug was introduced into [mariadb 5.2](../../mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) in the December 2010 with\
          the patch that added a new engine property: the ability to support\
          virtual columns.
        * As a result of this bug the information from frm files for tables\
          that contained virtual columns did not appear in the information schema\
          tables.

        * Fixed [Bug #884175](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/884175).
        * If in the where clause of the a query some comparison conditions on the\
          field under a MIN/MAX aggregate function contained constants whose sizes\
          exceeded the size of the field then the query could return a wrong result\
          when the optimizer had chosen to apply the MIN/MAX optimization.
        * With such conditions the MIN/MAX optimization still could be applied, yet\
          it would require a more thorough analysis of the keys built to find\
          the value of MIN/MAX aggregate functions with index look-ups.
        * The current patch just prohibits using the MIN/MAX optimization in this\
          situation.

        * Do not call, directly or indirectly, SQL\_SELECT::test\_quick\_select()\
          for derived materialized tables / views when optimizing joins referring\
          to these tables / views to get cost estimates of materialization.
        * The current code does not create B-tree indexes for materialized\
          derived tables / views. So now it's not possible to get any estimates\
          for ranges conditions over the results of the materialization.
        * The function mysql\_derived\_create() must take into account the fact\
          that array of the KEY structures specifying the keys over a derived\
          table / view may be moved after the optimization phase if the\
          derived table / view is materialized.

        * The bug would show up
          * when using PS (so that we get re-execution)
          * the left\_expr of the subquery is a reference to viewname.column\_name, so that it crashes\
            when one tries to use it without having called fix\_fields for it.
          * when using SJ-Materialization, which makes use of sj\_subq\_pred->left\_expr expression
        * The fix is to have setup\_conds() fix sj\_subq\_pred->left\_expr for semi-join nests it finds.
