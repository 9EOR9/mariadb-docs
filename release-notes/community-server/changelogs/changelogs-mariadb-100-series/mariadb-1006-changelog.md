      * An addition to fix for [MDEV-5205](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-5205), fixes server crash on shutdown.
      * Thread groups are destroyed asynchronously, that is kill server thread sends shutdown request to all thread groups without waiting for compeltion.
      * It means all\_groups array must not be freed until all thread groups are down. This patch suggests that all\_groups is freed when last thread group is destroyed.
      * Note 1: threadpool code doesn't surround atomic ops with atomic locks, thus no locks for shutdown\_group\_count. Note 2: this patch preserves old behaviour, but we may need to wait until all thread groups are down before returning from tp\_end().

    * The problem was that MySQL 5.6 added some croatian and vitanamese character set collations that are incompatible with MariaDB.
    * The fix is to move the MariaDB conflicting collation numbers out of the region that MySQL is likely to use. mysql\_upgrade, REPAIR TABLE or ALTER TABLE will fix the collations. If one tries to access and old incompatible table, one will get the error "Table upgrade required...." After this patch, MariaDB supports all the MySQL character set collations and the old MariaDB croatian collations, which are closer to the latest standard than the MySQL versions.
    * New character sets: ucs2\_croatian\_mysql561\_uca\_ci utf8\_croatian\_mysql561\_uca\_ci utf16\_croatian\_mysql561\_uca\_ci utf32\_croatian\_mysql561\_uca\_ci utf8mb4\_croatian\_mysql561\_uca\_ci

    * [MDEV-4506](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4506): Parallel replication [MDEV-5217](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-5217): Incorrect MyISAM event execution order causing incorrect parallel replication
    * In parallel replication, if transactions A,B group-commit together on the master, we can execute them in parallel on a replication slave. But then, if transaction C follows on the master, on the slave, we need to be sure that both A and B have completed before starting on C to be sure to avoid conflicts.
    * The necessary wait is implemented such that B waits for A to commit before it commits itself (thus preserving commit order). And C waits for B to commit before it itself can start executing. This way C does not start until both A and B have completed.
    * The wait for B's commit on A happens inside the commit processing. However, in the case of MyISAM with no binlog enabled on the slave, it appears that no commit processing takes place (since MyISAM is non-transactional), and thus the wait of B for A was not done. This allowed C to start before A, which can lead to conflicts and incorrect replication.
    * Fixed by doing an extra wait for A at the end of B before signalling C.

    * There was a race in the code for wait\_for\_commit::wakeup().
    * Since the waiter does a dirty read of the waiting\_for\_commit flag, it was possible for the waiter to complete and deallocate the wait\_for\_commit object while the waitee was still running inside wakeup(). This would cause the waitee to access invalid memory.
    * Fixed by putting an extra lock/unlock in the destructor for wait\_for\_commit, to ensure that waitee has finished with the object before it is deallocated.

    * The rli->event\_relay\_log\_pos was sometimes undated incorrectly when using parallel replication, especially around relay log rotates. This could cause the SQL thread to seek into an invalid position in the relay log, resulting in errors about invalid events or even random corruption in some cases.

    * For some reason, the query execution code in log\_event.cc call rli->clear\_error for each event (part of clear\_all\_errors()). This causes a problem in parallel replication, where the execution in one worker thread could clear the error set by another thread, causing the SQL thread to stop but leaving no error visible in SHOW SLAVE STATUS.
    * There seems to be no reason to clear the global error code in Relay\_log\_info for each event execution, from code review and from running the test suite. So remove this clearing of the error code to make things work also in the parallel case.

    * Normally, when we stop the slave SQL thread in parallel replication, we want the worker threads to continue processing events until the end of the current event group. But if we stop due to an error that prevents further events from being queued, such as an error reading the relay log, no more events can be queued for the workers, so they have to abort even if they are in the middle of an event group. There was a bug that we would deadlock, the workers waiting for more events to be queued for the event group, the SQL thread stopped and waiting for the workers to complete their current event group before exiting.
    * Fixed by now signalling from the SQL thread to all workers when it is about to exit, and cleaning up in all workers when so signalled.
    * This patch fixes one of multiple problems reported in [MDEV-5217](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-5217).
