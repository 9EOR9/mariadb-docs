      * Fixed [Bug #946055](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/946055).
      * The function create\_hj\_key\_for\_table() that builds the descriptor of\
        the hash join key to access a table of a materialized subquery must\
        ignore any equi-join predicate depending on the tables not belonging\
        to the subquery.

      * Ensure that we mark all processed tables as 'properly closed'.
      * This is needed as last log entry may be a DDL that is not processed and then a table may be left in 'not properly closed state' even if information is correct in it.
    * [Revision #2502.540.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.5-release/revision/2502.540.1)\
      Tue 2012-02-28 23:18:52 +0200
      * Fixed [Bug #925377](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/925377) "Querying myisam table metadata while 'alter table..enable keys' is running may corrupt the table"
      * Fixed wrong mutex order bug in Aria when flush\_log\_for\_bitmap() was called when table is not yet marked for change.
  * [Revision #2502.513.72](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.5-release/revision/2502.513.72)\
    Mon 2012-03-05 15:48:12 +0200
    * Fix for [Bug #944504](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/944504)
    * Problem is that subquery execution can't be called during prepare/optimize phase.
    * Also small fix for subquery test suite.
  * [Revision #2502.513.71](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.5-release/revision/2502.513.71)\
    Sun 2012-03-04 22:38:17 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #944782](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/944782).
    * This bug in the function JOIN::drop\_unused\_derived\_keys() could\
      leave the internal structures for a materialized derived table\
      in an inconsistent state. This led to a not quite correct EXPLAIN\
      output when no additional key had been created to access the table.\
      It also may lead to more serious consequences: so, the test case\
      added with this fix caused a crash in mariadb-5.5.20.

      * Fixed [Bug #923236](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/923236).
      * When working on [MWL#247](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=247) I forgot to adjust the function create\_hj\_key\_for\_table()\
        that created a key definition for hash join keys. The modified function must\
        set the values of the fields ext\_key\_parts, ext\_key\_flags, ext\_key\_part\_map\
        added to the key definition structure in [MWL#247](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=247).

      Tue 2012-01-24 23:34:02 -0800
      * Fixed LP bug #921167.
      * The fields ext\_key\_flags and ext\_key\_part\_map must be initialized for any\
        key, even for a MyISAM key that never is considered by the optimizer as one\
        extended by hidden components.

        * Fixed [Bug #914560](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/914560).
        * The patch for [MWL#247](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=247) forgot to initialize the TABLE::ext\_key\_parts and\
          TABLE::ext\_key\_flags of the temporary tables by a query. This could cause\
          crashes for queries the execution of which needed creation of temporary\
          tables.

        * Fixed calculation of rec\_per\_key elements for added components of the extended keys.
        * Slightly corrected the implementation of the function ha\_innobase::read\_time().
        * Changed the implementation of handler::keyread\_time to make the cost of single key\
          index only look-ups dependent on the key entry length.
        * Corrected the index of the last possible components of an extended key in the\
          function best\_access\_path().

        * Fixed [Bug #905716](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/905716) "Assertion \`page->size <= share->max\_index\_block\_size'"
        * The issue was that Aria allowed too long keys to be created (so that the internal buffer was not big enough to hold the whole key).
        * Key lengths is now limited to HA\_MAX\_KEY\_LENGTH (1000), as for MyISAM.
        * Fixed failure in "\_ma\_apply\_redo\_index: Assertion \`new\_page\_length == 0", as found by buildbot.

      * Fixed [Bug #939009](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/939009).
      * The result of materialization of the right part of an IN subquery predicate\
        is placed into a temporary table. Each row of the materialized table is\
        distinct. A unique key over all fields of the temporary table is defined and\
        created. It allows to perform key look-ups into the table.\
        The table created for a materialized subquery can be accessed by key as\
        any other table. The function best\_access-path search for the best access\
        to join a table to a given partial join. With some where conditions this\
        function considers a possibility of a ref\_or\_null access. If such access\
        employs the unique key on the temporary table then when estimating\
        the cost this access the function tries to use the array rec\_per\_key. Yet,\
        such array is not built for this unique key. This causes a crash of the server.
      * Rows returned by the subquery that contain nulls don't have to be placed\
        into temporary table, as they cannot be match any row produced by the\
        left part of the subquery predicate. So all fields of the temporary table\
        can be defined as non-nullable. In this case any ref\_or\_null access\
        to the temporary table does not make any sense and it does not make sense\
        to estimate such an access.
      * The fix makes sure that the temporary table for a materialized IN subquery\
        is defined with columns that are all non-nullable. The also ensures that\
        any row with nulls returned by the subquery is not placed into the\
        temporary table.

    * Allow for faster creation of threads in corner cases where pool would be overloaded with long non-yielding queries.
    * To allow it, change minimum of thread\_pool\_stall\_limit to be 10 milliseconds.
    * Also introduce a new parameter to oversubscribe a group . Number of threads running in parallel would be higher than it normally should, leading to thrashing, but it may improving preemptiveness, which is useful for the described corner case.

      * [MWL#192](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=192): non-blocking client API, after-review fixes.
      * Main change is that non-blocking operation is now an option that must be\
        explicitly enabled with mysql\_option(mysql, MYSQL\_OPT\_NONBLOCK, ...)\
        before any non-blocing operation can be used.
      * Also the CLIENT\_REMEMBER\_OPTIONS flag is now always enabled and thus\
        effectively ignored (it was not really useful anyway, and this simplifies\
        things when non-blocking mysql\_real\_connect() fails).
    * [Revision #2502.531.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.5-release/revision/2502.531.1)\

      * [MWL#192](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=192): Non-blocking client API for libmysqlclient.
      * All client functions that can block on I/O have alternate \_start() and\
        \_cont() versions that do not block but return control back to the\
        application, which can then issue I/O wait in its own fashion and later\
        call back into the library to continue the operation.
      * Works behind the scenes by spawning a co-routine/fiber to run the\
        blocking operation and suspend it while waiting for I/O. This\
        co-routine/fiber use is invisible to applications.
      * For i368/x86\_64 on GCC, uses very fast assembler co-routine support. On\
        Windows uses native Win32 Fibers. Falls back to POSIX ucontext on other\
        platforms. Assembler routines for more platforms are relatively easy to\
        add by extending mysys/my\_context.c, eg. similar to the Lua lcoco\
        library.
      * For testing, mysqltest and mysql\_client\_test are extended with the\
        option `--non-blocking-api`. This causes the programs to use the\
        non-blocking API for database access. mysql-test-run.pl has a similar\
        option `--non-blocking-api` that uses this, as well as additional\
        testcases.
      * An example program tests/async\_queries.c is included that uses the new\
        non-blocking API with libevent to show how, in a single-threaded\
        program, to issue many queries in parallel against a database.
