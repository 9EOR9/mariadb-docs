      * Fixed [Bug #915222](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/915222)
      * This bug happened because the function find\_field\_in\_view formed\

        them back. In some situation it could cause memory misuses reported\
        by valgrind or even crashes.

    * Fix of [Bug #968720](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/968720).
    * When a view/derived table is converted from merged to materialized the\
      items from the used\_item lists are substituted for items referring to\
      the fields of the result of the materialization. The problem appeared\
      with queries employing natural joins. Since the resolution of a natural\
      join was performed only once the used\_item list formed at the second\
      execution of the query lacked the references to the fields that were\
      used only in the equality predicates generated for the natural join.

        * [Bug #913030](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/913030): Optimizer chooses a suboptimal excution plan for Q18 from DBT-3
        * When doing join optimization, pre-sort the tables so that they mimic the execution\
          order we've had with 'semijoin=off'.
        * That way, we will not get regressions when there are two query plans (the old and the\
          new) that have indentical costs but different execution times (because of factors that\
          the optimizer was not able to take into account).

        * I also fixed wrong freeing of blob's in the CSV handler. (Any call to handler::read\_first\_row() on a CSV table with blobs would fail)
