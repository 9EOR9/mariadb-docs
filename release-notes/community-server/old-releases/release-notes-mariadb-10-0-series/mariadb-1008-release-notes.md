## Notable changes

[MariaDB 10.0.8](mariadb-1008-release-notes.md) is primarily a bug-fix and polishing release.

Notable changes of this release include:

* Fixes for the following security vulnerabilities:
  * [CVE-2014-0412](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0412)
  * [CVE-2014-0401](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0401)
  * [CVE-2014-0437](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0437)
  * [CVE-2014-0420](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0420)
  * [CVE-2013-5908](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5908)
* InnoDB upgraded to version 5.6.14
* [FLUSH ... FOR EXPORT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush-tables-for-export) works
* Added a new server variable, [old\_mode](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#old_mode), to allow selectively restoring old behavior, in contrast to the old "all-or-nothing" approach of the `--old` command-line option. See [OLD MODE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/old-mode) for more.
* Added a new read-only server variable [malloc\_library](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#malloc_version)
* Bundled [PCRE library](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/string-functions/regular-expressions-functions/pcre) upgraded to version 8.34
* The [CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table#create-or-replace) statement was added. It is used internally for replication ([MDEV-5491](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-5491)), but it is also can be used by clients as any other SQL statement.
  * This enables replication to be able to continue even if the slave crashes (due to, for example, a bug or power outage) in the middle of a `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE ... SELECT`, or `DROP TABLE`. When the slave comes back up it can replay the statement without any data loss if needed.
  * As part of this change, the [slave-ddl-exec-mode](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables) variable was added. It specifies how `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` statements are replicated.
