## Notable Items

### InnoDB

* InnoDB no longer acquires advisory file locks by default ([MDEV-24393](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-24393))
* Encryption: Automatically disable key rotation checks for file\_key\_management plugin ([MDEV-14180](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-14180))
* Some fixes from MySQL 5.7.35 ([MDEV-26205](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26205))

### Optimizer

* A query that uses ORDER BY .. LIMIT clause and "Range checked for\
  each record optimization" could produce incorrect results under some\
  circumstances ([MDEV-25858](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25858))
* Queries that have more than 32 equality conditions\
  comparing columns of different tables ("tableX.colX=tableY.colY) could cause\
  a stack overrun in the query optimizer ([MDEV-17783](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17783), [MDEV-23937](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-23937))
* "Condition pushdown into derived table" optimization cannot be\
  applied if the expression being pushed refers to a derived table column which\
  is computed from expression that has a stored function call, @session variable\
  reference, or other similar construct.\
  The fix for [MDEV-25969](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25969) makes it so that only the problematic part of the\
  condition is not pushed. The rest of the condition is now pushed. ([MDEV-25969](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25969))
* A query with window function on the left side of the subquery could\
  cause a crash. ([MDEV-25630](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25630))

### Packaging & Misc

* As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](../../about/platform-deprecation-policy.md), this will be the last release of [MariaDB 10.4](https://mariadb.com/docs/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series) for Ubuntu 20.10 Groovy
* [Galera](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/galera-cluster/README.md) updated to 26.4.9

MongoDB protocol support files for the [CONNECT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/connect) engine are missing in this release.\
If you want to use [CONNECT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/connect) engine with MongoDB, you need to download[Mongo2.jar](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/raw/mariadb-10.2.38/storage/connect/mysql-test/connect/std_data/Mongo2.jar) or [Mongo3.jar](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/raw/mariadb-10.2.38/storage/connect/mysql-test/connect/std_data/Mongo3.jar) and put a path to this file into the `connect_class_path` in the `my.cnf`.
