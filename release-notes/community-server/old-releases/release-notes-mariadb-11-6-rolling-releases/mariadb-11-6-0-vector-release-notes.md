[MariaDB 11.6](what-is-mariadb-116.md) Vector is a [rolling release](../../about/release-model.md). It is an evolution of [MariaDB 11.5](../release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115.md) with several entirely new features.

[MariaDB 11.6.0](mariadb-11-6-0-release-notes.md) Vector is a preview release intended to highlight early work on Vectors. Features are to be considered preview, and will not be a part of [MariaDB 11.6](what-is-mariadb-116.md).

It is available as a source download only from the download site, and is available as a container **quay.io/mariadb-foundation/mariadb-devel:11.6-preview**.

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB!
