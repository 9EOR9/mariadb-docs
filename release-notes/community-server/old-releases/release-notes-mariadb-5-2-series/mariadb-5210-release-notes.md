**Release date:** 5 Dec 2011

[MariaDB 5.2.10](mariadb-5210-release-notes.md) is a [Stable release](../../about/release-criteria.md).In general this means\
there are no known serious bugs and we believe the code is ready for general\
usage. A "stable" MariaDB release is equivalent to a MySQL "GA" release.

**For a detailed description of** [**MariaDB 5.2**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) **see the** [**What is MariaDB 5.2**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) **page.**

Compared to [MariaDB 5.2.9](mariadb-529-release-notes.md), [MariaDB 5.2.10](mariadb-5210-release-notes.md) is a\
bug-fix release.

For a list of every change made in [MariaDB 5.2.10](mariadb-5210-release-notes.md), with links to detailed\
information on each push, see the [MariaDB 5.2.10 Changelog](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/broken-reference/README.md).

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
