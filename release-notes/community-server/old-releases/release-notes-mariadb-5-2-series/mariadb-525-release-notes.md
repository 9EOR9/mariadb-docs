In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

[MariaDB 5.2.5](mariadb-525-release-notes.md) contains the following changes:

## Includes [MariaDB 5.1.55](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5155-release-notes.md)

For [MariaDB 5.2.5](mariadb-525-release-notes.md) we have merged in all of the changes from [MariaDB 5.1.55](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5155-release-notes.md),\
including all of the upstream changes from MySQL 5.1.54 and 5.1.55. The MySQL [5.1.54](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-54.html) and [5.1.55](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-55.html) release\
notes have details of what changes were made upstream by MySQL since 5.1.53.

See the [MariaDB 5.1.55 Changelog](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/broken-reference/README.md) for a detailed list of the changes in [MariaDB 5.1.55](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5155-release-notes.md).

## Includes [XtraDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-unmaintained/about-xtradb) 5.1.54-12.5

We have included XtraDB from Percona Server 5.1.54-12.5 in this version of\
MariaDB. See the Percona Server[release\
notes](https://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/percona-server:release_notes_51) for what changes were made upstream by Percona.

## New Debian and Ubuntu Repositories

As with [MariaDB 5.1.55](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5155-release-notes.md), for this version of MariaDB we are pleased to announce\
the availability of Debian and Ubuntu repositories that we will keep up-to-date\
going forward. The new repositories make use of our world-wide network of\
MariaDB mirrors and will enable hassle-free upgrades to the latest version of\
MariaDB as soon as it is released.

See [Installing MariaDB .deb Files](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files) for\
information how to setup your Debian or Ubuntu system to use the new\
repositories.

## RPM Package Signing

As part of the new Debian and Ubuntu repositories we have also [signed the RPM packages](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/checking-mariadb-rpm-package-signatures).\
All RPM package releases going forward will be signed.

## New Downloads System

With this version of MariaDB we are also debuting a new [MariaDB downloads website](https://downloads.askmonty.org). This new site\
allows you to filter the various files to show only the ones you are interested\
in and it will attempt to locate the nearest mirror to you based on your IP\
address.

## Bug Fixes

fixes and other improvements. Specific bugs fixed in [MariaDB 5.2.5](mariadb-525-release-notes.md) are listed\
in the [MariaDB 5.2.5 Changelog](../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-52-series/mariadb-525-changelog.md) and [MariaDB 5.1.55 Changelog](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/broken-reference/README.md).
