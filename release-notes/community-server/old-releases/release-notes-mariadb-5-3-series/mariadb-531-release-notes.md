[MariaDB 5.3.1](mariadb-531-release-notes.md) is a [Beta release](../../about/release-criteria.md). In general this means\
that there are no known serious bugs, except for those marked as feature\
requests. [MariaDB 5.3](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) radically improves performance for subqueries as well as\
for joins and single-table queries over large data sets.

information on each push, see the[MariaDB 5.3.1 Changelog](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/broken-reference/README.md). It is worth noting that[MariaDB 5.3](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) is built on [MariaDB 5.2](../release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md),[MariaDB 5.1](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md), and MySQL 5.1.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
