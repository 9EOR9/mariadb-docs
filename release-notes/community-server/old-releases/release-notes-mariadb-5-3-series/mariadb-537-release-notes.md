**Release date:** 4 May 2012

[MariaDB 5.3.7](mariadb-537-release-notes.md) is a [_**Stable**_](../../about/release-criteria.md) _**(GA)**_ release. In\
general this means that there are no known serious bugs, except for those\
marked as feature requests, that no bugs were fixed since last release that\
caused notable code changes, and that we believe the code is ready for\
general usage (based on bug inflow).

interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
