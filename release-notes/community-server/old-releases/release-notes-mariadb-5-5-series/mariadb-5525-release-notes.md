[MariaDB 5.5.25](mariadb-5525-release-notes.md) is a [_**Stable**_](../../about/release-criteria.md) _**(GA)**_\
release. In general this means that there are no known serious bugs,\
except for those marked as feature requests, that no bugs were fixed\
since last release that caused a notable code changes, and that we\
believe the code is ready for general usage (based on bug inflow).
