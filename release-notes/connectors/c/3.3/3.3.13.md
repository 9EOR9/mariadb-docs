## Notable changes

* Added TLSv1.3 support for Schannel (Windows)
* Added new option -DWITH\_BOOST\_CONTEXT. CMake option -DWITH\_BOOST\_CONTEXT=ON adds boost::context as a dependency of libmariadb to provide a fallback on non-natively supported architectures. boost::context is preferred over ucontext when both are available.

## Issues fixed:

* Fixed possible crash if not default plugin was loaded.
* [CONC-730](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-730): Undefined behavior in the reference ed25519 implementation
* [CONC-527](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-527): Fixed error "SEC\_E\_ALGORITHM\_MISMATCH" connecting Windows client to Ubuntu
* [CONC-735](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-735): A reconnect doesn't do node failover when using a connection string with multiple hosts
* [MDEV-34859](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34859): Failed to initialise non-blocking API on OpenBSD arm64
