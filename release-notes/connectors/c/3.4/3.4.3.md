**Release date:** 12 Nov 2024

This is a [_**Stable (GA)**_](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/C, formerly known as MariaDB Client Library for C.

MariaDB Connector/C 3.4.2 was not released separately but is included in [MariaDB Community Server 11.4.4](../../../community-server/mariadb-11-4-series/mariadb-11-4-4-release-notes.md). MariaDB Connector/C 3.4.3 includes additional bug fixes for the Connector and is included in [MariaDB Community Server 11.6.2](../../../community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-6-rolling-releases/mariadb-11-6-2-release-notes.md), and [11.7.1](../../../community-server/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/mariadb-11-7-1-release-notes.md).

## Notable Changes

* Added option MARIADB\_TLS\_VERIFY\_STATUS to retrieve status of peer certificate validation via mariadb\_get\_infov().
* [CONC-690](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-690): Due to required cryptographic functions that are part of the TLS crypto libraries the option WITH\_SSL=OFF (disabling TLS/SSL) is no longer supported and will result in a build error.
* [CONC-724](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-724): Added option MARIADB\_OPT\_TLS\_VERIFICATION\_CALLBACK to specify a callback function for peer certificate testing.
* Man pages are no longer stored in github repository. They can be build with cmake option -DWITH\_DOCS=ON (requires pyhon 3 and pandoc).
* If the environment variable MARIADB\_TLS\_DISABLE\_PEER\_VERIFICATION was set, the peer certificate verification will be skipped.
* [CONC-717](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-717): Added windows support for the parsec authentication plugin, a new plugin added to MariaDB Server 11.6

## Issues fixed:

* [CONC-712](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-712): Skip host name verification on local connections
* [CONC-731](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-731): Wrong error message if incorrect fingerprint was specified
* [CONC-732](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-732): Always set verification callback function, even if peer certificate validation is disabled (OpenSSL)
* [CONC-735](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-735): A reconnect doesn't do node failover when using a connection string with multiple hosts
