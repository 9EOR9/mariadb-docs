  * timeout values, which are "unsigned int" in both the connector API and the underlying sockets API, transit at some point into signed int and are assigned the value "-1" whenever the timeout is not defined. The resulting socket timeout being computed based on the conversion of -1 to an unsigned int, instead of being "0" (no socket timeout). Kudos to Nicolas Leroux for providing the patch.
