## Notable changes

In addition to various minor bug fixes, in this release we have updated the minor version number (skipped over `3.2.1`) so that this series is in sync with the [MariaDB 10.6](../../../community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106.md) minor version number. Going forward, releases in the [Connector/C 3.2](changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-connector-c-32.md) series will correspond to the same minor version of [MariaDB 10.6](../../../community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106.md). e.g. Connector/C 3.2.2 is included in [MariaDB 10.6.2](../../../community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-1062-release-notes.md).
