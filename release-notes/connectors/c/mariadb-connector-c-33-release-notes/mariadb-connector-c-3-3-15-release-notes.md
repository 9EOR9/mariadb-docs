## Issues fixed:

* [CONC-760](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-760): Valid named pipe connection on Windows is closed. Fixed different behavior of pvio\_is\_alive (which was first used with fix of [CONC-589](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-589)). Both for sockets and named pipe the function now returns true if the connection is alive, otherwise false
