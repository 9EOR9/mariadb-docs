**Release date:** 8 Feb 2018

This is a [Stable (GA)](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.0.

MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.0.3 is built on top of [MariaDB Connector/C v.3.0.3](../../c/3.0/3.0.3.md) and uses the\
binary prepared statement protocol.

## Bug Fixes

* [ODBC-134](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-134): Fetch would fail if an unbound column contained NULL and if that\
  column some arbitrary descriptor field that was set by the application (but\
  not length/indicator buffer pointers). The bug affected ADO, as that is\
  something it can do in some cases with CursorLocation adUseClient
* [ODBC-119](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-119): The connector ordered SQLStatistics results using the wrong\
  columns. This could cause MS Access to pick the wrong column as a unique\
  index.
* [ODBC-131](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-131): While linking a table, MS Access threw an error when it received an\
  unexpected length for SQLSMALLINT and SQLINTEGER columns in a SQLColumns\
  resultset.
* [ODBC-126](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-126): Core dump when procedure returned more than 1 result set
* [ODBC-123](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-123): Crashes reading a MariaDB table with LibreOffice
* [ODBC-120](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-120): Performance issue. Connector did redundant calls of\
  mysql\_stmt\_data\_seek
