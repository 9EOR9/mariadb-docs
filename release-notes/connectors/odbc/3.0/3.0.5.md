**Release date:** 12 Jun 2018

This is a [Stable (GA)](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.0.

MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.0.5 is built on top of [MariaDB Connector/C v.3.0.5](../../c/3.0/3.0.5.md). It also includes all fixes from [MariaDB Connector/C v.3.0.4](../../c/3.0/3.0.4.md).

## Bug Fixes

* [ODBC-146](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-146) Wrong decimal value (0) when after longtext field in select clause (using ADO, client side cursor)
* Testing connector against last server build on travis. Those tests permit to check early regression and might failed, so tagged as "Allowed Failures" on travis
* [ODBC-126](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-126) Fetching Multiple Result Set Crash - fix of the case, not covered by this bug fix in previous release
* Connector library now does not export anything beyond the API
* [ODBC-141](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-141) Error using LOAD DATA INFILE
* [ODBC-143](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-143) Wrong SQL\_IDENTIFIER\_QUOTE\_CHAR info in case of ANSI\_QUOTES
* [ODBC-138](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-138) Connector could sometimes return wrong datetime value
* Connector/ODBC is now built with Connector/C as a git sub-project. That fixes build issues like [ODBC-39](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-39), [ODBC-40](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-40), [ODBC-124](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-124) and [ODBC-135](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-135)
* [ODBC-133](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-133) Incorrect return values for decimal data type
* [ODBC-137](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-137) ODBC and Swedish characters
* [ODBC-91](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-91) If the connection handles was reused, the connector would try to use default database from previous connection (and if there wasn't such database the connect would fail)
