**Release date:** 30 May 2025

This is a [Stable (GA)](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.2.

MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.2.6 is built on top of [MariaDB Connector/C v.3.4.5](../../c/3.4/3.4.5.md).

## Bug Fixes

* [ODBC-460](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-460) - Crash in SQLExecDirect on UPDATE statement with array of parameters
* [ODBC-461](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-461) - The destructor releasing server side prepared statement could throw and this exception would not be caught
* [ODBC-458](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-458) - MS Access won't work with the linked table if best row id is BIGINT
* [ODBC-459](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-459) - MS Access shows record with AUTO\_INCREMENT primary key as #Deleted after insert that does not specify that field value
* [ODBC-462](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-462) - SQLExecDirect on array of parameters could issue multistatement query even if multistatement option had not been selected for the connection.
* [ODBC-464](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-464) - Multiple issues with current implementation of SQLCancel
* [ODBC-466](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-466) - SQLCancel could run on already dropped statement due to race condition
* [ODBC-467](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-467) - Possible crash in SQLCancelHandle

## New Feature

* [ODBC-457](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/ODBC-457) - Introduced option TRUNCDT to skip time truncation error. Setting it to non-zero value makes connector not to return error on date/time type parameter value truncation. These are when value for SQL\_TIME contains fractional part, or for SQL\_DATE contains non-zero time. In particular, that permits to insert value with fractional part into TIME field which in MariaDB can have fractional part as ODBC SQL\_TIME type.
