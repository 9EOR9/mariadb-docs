**Release date:** 2 Apr 2014

MariaDB ODBC Driver 0.9.1 is a [Beta](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) release. In general\
this means that there are no known serious bugs, except for those marked as\
feature requests, but we feel it needs further testing and development before\
we call it _stable_.

MariaDB ODBC Driver 0.9.1 is built on top of the MariaDB LPGL C Client library\
and uses the binary prepared statement protocol.

Please, note that a beta version is NOT the final version of the product and we\
do not guarantee an absence of errors that may disrupt the computer's operation\
system and/or result data loss. We recommend against use of any beta software\
in a critical, commercial or production environment. Implementation of beta\
software should be limited to experienced users only in a staging or test\
environment.
