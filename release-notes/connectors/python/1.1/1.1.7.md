**Release date:** 10 Jul 2023

This is a [_**stable**_](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/Python.

**For a description of this library see the** [**MariaDB Connector/Python documentation**](https://mariadb-corporation.github.io/mariadb-connector-python/index.html) **.**

MariaDB Connector/Python enables python programs to access MariaDB and MySQL databases, using an API which is compliant with the Python DB API 2.0 (PEP-249). It is written in C and uses MariaDB Connector/C client library for client server communication.

## Notable changes

* [CONPY-253](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-253): The connection method now offers the option of specifying the version of the TLS protocol using tls\_version.

## Bug fixes

* [CONPY-258](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-258): Fixed ValueError exception if ZEROFILL flag is defined
* [CONPY-255](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-255): If all connections from a pool are in use, pool.get\_connection now returns None instead of raising an exception.
* [CONPY-256](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-256): Fix indexing when moving a free connection to used connections to avoid returning the same connection twice. Kudos and thanks to G.Mech for reporting this bug and providing the fix.
