**Release date:** 22 Dec 2023

This is a [_**stable**_](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/Python.

**For a description of this library see the** [**MariaDB Connector/Python documentation**](https://mariadb-corporation.github.io/mariadb-connector-python/index.html) **.**

MariaDB Connector/Python enables python programs to access MariaDB and MySQL databases, using an API which is compliant with the Python DB API 2.0 (PEP-249). It is written in C and uses MariaDB Connector/C client library for client server communication.

## Bug fixes

* [CONPY-276](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-276): Allow to retrieve data from buffered cursor if the connection was already closed before.
* [CONPY-274](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-274): Instead of releasing non freed objects (cursor and connection) in tp\_dealloc, they are freed now in tp\_finalize to avoid possible crashes.
* [CONPY-273](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONPY-273): Fixed crash in escape\_string of the connection object
