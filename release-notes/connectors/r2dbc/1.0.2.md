# MariaDB Connector/R2DBC 1.0.2 Release Notes

## Overview

MariaDB Connector/R2DBC is a non-blocking interface between Java applications and MariaDB Server. MariaDB Connector/R2DBC enables the development of Java 8+ applications for MariaDB database products.

MariaDB Connector/R2DBC 1.0.2 was released on 2021-07-19. This release is compatible with [R2DBC 0.8.5](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.8.5.RELEASE/spec/html/) specification.
