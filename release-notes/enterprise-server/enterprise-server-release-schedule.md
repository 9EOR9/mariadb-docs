# Enterprise Server Release Schedule

## Enterprise Server Release Schedule

[MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/products/mariadb-enterprise-server/) enables a predictable development and operations experience through an [enterprise lifecycle](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/products/mariadb-enterprise-server/lifecycle/). This enterprise lifecycle incorporates optimized builds, predictable release behavior, and vendor support.

Minor and maintenance releases of MariaDB Enterprise Server incorporate bug fixes and security fixes. Like all releases of MariaDB Enterprise Server, minor and maintenance releases undergo extensive QA testing before release to customers.

The frequency of minor and maintenance releases is variable. Minor or maintenance releases occur for each release series at least quarterly. A portion of minor and maintenance releases occur on a pre-scheduled basis. Additional releases may be added by MariaDB Corporation between scheduled release dates to manage the flow of change or to address specific defects.

### Next Scheduled Releases

Upcoming minor or maintenance releases are scheduled for:

* 2025-06-09
* 2025-09-08
* 2025-12-15
