  Sun 2011-07-31 22:25:37 +0200
  * Speed up mysql-test-run.pl.
  * Problem was the parsing of test suite files for various tags and options.
  * This was done inefficiently, and include files were re-parsed for every\
    place they were included. This caused a delay of 20 seconds or so before\
    the first test started to run.
  * By parsing more efficiently and re-using first parse for subsequent\
    inclusion of the same file, time spent parsing is reduced to less than\
    1 second, and start appears instantaneous.
  * (With this patch, full ./mtr runs in 3 minutes on my laptop (release\
    build.)

  * The bug happens when one uses MAX\_ROWS=

## with Aria & row\_format=page and one insert more than

## rows.

  * Fix of [Bug #777809](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/777809)
  * There are 2 volatile condition constructions AND/OR constructions and fields(references) when first\
    good supported to be top elements of conditions because it is normal practice\
    (see copy\_andor\_structure for example) fields without any expression in the condition is really rare\
    and mostly useless case however it could lead to problems when optimiser changes/moves them unaware\
    of other variables referring to them. An easy solution of this problem is just to replace single field\
    in a condition with equivalent expression well supported by the server ( -> != 0).

  * Fix mysqltest printing of include stack.
  * The printing of include stack in the error case in mysqltest omitted the\
    bottom of the stack (the line number in original test case file), and instead\
    printed the top of the stack twice. Fix to print each element on the stack\
    once and only once.

  * Fix buildbot failure in rpl\_stop\_slave.test.
  * Problem was setting DEBUG\_SYNC twice in a row too fast in the test case; this\
    could cause the second setting to override the first before the code had time\
    to react to the first, causing the signal to get lost.
  * Fixed by waiting for the code to receive the first signal before overwriting\
    it in the test case.

    * Avoid mtr warning on Windows during startup
    * The reason for mtr warning is that collect\_mysqld\_features() starts\
      mysqld with `--datadir=/tmp` and this directory does not exist on Windows.
    * Fix : instead of passing `--datadir=$opt_vardir/tmp`\
      in `collect_mysqld_features()` just\
      use `--datadir=`. mysqld does not need a correct\
      directory, just an existing one, as it is started\
      with `--help ---verbose --skip-grant-tables`.
