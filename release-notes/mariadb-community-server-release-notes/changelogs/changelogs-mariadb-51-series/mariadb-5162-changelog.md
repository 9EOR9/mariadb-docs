    * Fixed [Bug #970528](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/970528) "Server crashes in my\_strnncollsp\_simple on LEFT JOIN with CSV table, TEXT field"
    * The main problem was a bug in CSV where it provided wrong statistics (it claimed the table was empty when it wasn't)
    * I also fixed wrong freeing of blob's in the CSV handler. (Any call to handler::read\_first\_row() on a CSV table with blobs would fail)
