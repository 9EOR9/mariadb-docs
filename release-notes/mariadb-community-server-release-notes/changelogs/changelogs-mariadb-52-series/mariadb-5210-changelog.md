    server does not ensure reply was fully read by client, before shutting down and closing\

    Thu 2011-11-24 19:23:20 +0200
    * Fixed that one can use --maria-recover=backup,force\
      (Before we only allowed one option)
* [Revision #3054](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2-release/revision/3054)\
  Tue 2011-11-29 08:50:54 +0100
  * Fix testcases:
    1. main.merge fails with errno 13 in copy\_file().
    2. The reason for the error is that copy\_file tries to create a file with the same name as recently deleted one,\
       and there is still an open handle for the deleted file.\
       To fix, use my\_delete\_allow\_opened() for MTR's delete\_file. On Windows, this renames file to unique name\
       prior to deletion, and prevents EACCES errors for files opened with FILE\_SHARE\_DELETE.
    3. innodb\_bug59641
    4. generates warnings, after server was killed and restarted in the test case.
    5. The warnings are about test\_suppression table (needs to be repaired, as it that was written just prior to the crash)
    6. Fixed by using FLUSH TABLES after populating warning suppression table.
