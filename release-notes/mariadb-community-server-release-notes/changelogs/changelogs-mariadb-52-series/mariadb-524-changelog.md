      * Adapt fix\_vs\_config\_dir () for VS2010

    * [Revision #2643.96.34](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.34)
      * Fixed failures in buildbot
    * [Revision #2643.96.33](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.33)
      * [MySQL Bug #54201](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54201): "SET INSERT\_ID" event must be ignored if corresponding event is ignored
      * An INSERT query log event is preceeded by an INSERT\_ID intvar event if the\
        INSERT allocates a new auto\_increment value. But if we ignore the INSERT\
        due to `--replicate-ignore-table` or similar, then the INSERT\_ID event is\
        still executed, and the set value of INSERT\_ID lingers around in the\
        slave sql thread THD object indefinitely until the next INSERT that\
        happens to need allocation of a new auto\_increment value.
      * Normally this does not cause problems as such following INSERT would\
        normally come with its own INSERT\_ID event. In this bug, the user had\
        a trigger on the slave which was missing on the master, and this\
        trigger had an INSERT which could be affected. In any case, it seems\
        better to not leave a stray INSERT\_ID hanging around in the sql thread\
        THD indefinitely.
      * Note that events can also be skipped from apply\_event\_and\_update\_pos();\
        however it is not possible in that code to skip the INSERT without also\
        skipping the INSERT\_ID event.
* [Revision #2889](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2889)
  * Fixed compiler warnings

          * Fixed some compiler warnings
    * [Revision #2643.105.40](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.40)
      * Use three digits after the decimal point for better resolution and comparability of results.
    * [Revision #2643.105.39](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.39) \[merge]
      * Automatic merge with 5.1-release
        * [Revision #2643.96.31](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.31)
          * Fixed compiler and gmake warnings
            * Removed SCCS rule from Makefile.am
            * Made dummy rule in sql\_yacc.yy to get rid of compiler warning about not used label.

        * [Revision #2643.96.30](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.30)

          * Patch from Sergey Petrunya:
          * Fix post-merge failure in 5.1-merge
            * Let QUICK\_RANGE\_INTERSECT\_SELECT not make assumption that HA\_EXTRA\_KEYREAD\
              scans do not touch parts of table->record\[0] that refer to fields that are\
              not covered by the used index.
            * This assumption is not true for XtraDB (e.g. grep row/row0sel.c for\
              "init null bytes with default values as they might be").
        * [Revision #2643.96.28](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.28) \[merge]

        * [Revision #2643.96.25](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.25)
          * A proper fix for [MySQL Bug #57688](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=57688).
          * Introduced a new flag in the class Item. The flag is set\
            to 1 only for items that are used in GROUP BY lists of\
            queries with ROLLUP.
        * [Revision #2643.96.24](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.96.24) \[merge]

                * Werror is disabled; Should be enabled after merge with xtradb.

      * Fix of the debugging print.
    * [Revision #2643.105.35](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.35)
      * [MWL#74](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=74): Shared libmysqld.so library.
      * Switch makefiles to use libtool to build libmysqld.so, as well as all its\
        dependencies.
      * The previous MYSQL\_PLUGIN\_DEPENDS\_ON\_MYSQL\_INTERNALS() declaration is removed,\
        as it does not work well with a libtool build. Instead, plugins that need it\
        can specify an alternate object in MYSQL\_PLUGIN\_STATIC() that will be used for\
        embedded library. The plugin must then take care itself of compiling the\
        special object for embedded, rebuilding the source files previously listed in\
        MYSQL\_PLUGIN\_DEPENDS\_ON\_MYSQL\_INTERNALS() with @plugin\_embedded\_defs@ in\
        CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. The extra target @XXX\_embedded\_static\_target@ is available\
        for the special object, this will be empty when `--without-embedded-server`.
      * All in-tree plugins are changed to build their static targets with libtool.\
        Additional plugins that want to work with libmysqld.so will need to be\
        similarly modified to build with libtool (or otherwise provide an -fPIC\
        object). Dynamically loaded plugins are not affected.
      * The old libraries like libmysys.a, libmyisam.a and similar libraries, which\
        were installed by `make install` though this is of little use, are still built\
        and installed to not break package scripts etc. that expect them. These\
        libraries are kept static to avoid introducing new .so dependencies.
      * The patch also fixes a handfull of duplicate symbol linker errors, where we\
        included some object twice during linking; these for one reason or another did\
        not produce errors before but caused problems on some platforms with this\
        patch (eg. Mac OS X linker is more strict for shared objects).
      * This patch only does what is necessary to build libmysqld.so. There are some\
        more cleanups that are possible now that we are using libtool more fully,\
        which could done in subsequent patches (though we may not bother as we are\
        switching from autotools to CMake anyway):
        * In libmysql\_r/, we should be able to just link libmysys.la etc, instead of\
          symlinking and re-compiling sources into the directory.
        * In libmysql/, we can similarly avoid symlinking and recompiling sources if\
          we instead build a libmysys\_nothread.la library with appropriate CFLAGS and\
          link that.
        * In sql/, we can build a separate target libmysql\_int.la with appropriate\
          CFLAGS for embedded and use that in libmysqld/ instead of symlinking\
          sources.
        * libmysys.a, libmyisam.a and similar libraries could be installed as .so\
          also to save on code size; or alternatively could be not installed at all.
    * [Revision #2643.105.34](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.34)
      * [Bug #643463](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/643463): Slow XtraDB shutdown: Fix more sleeps delaying shutdown.
      * This patch removes most remaining delays due to uninteruptible sleep()\
        during shutdown, as found using PMP. This makes standard test run very\
        close in speed to with `--loose-innodb-fast-shutdown=2`, and greatly\
        speeds up running the test suite.
    * [Revision #2643.105.33](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.33)\
      Fix flags for non-debug builds
    * [Revision #2643.105.32](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.32)\
      Fixed mess in the types.
    * [Revision #2643.105.31](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.31)
      * Fixed bug discovered by testcase for [Bug #618558](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/618558) (original bug seams to be fixed):
        * Fixed bug in pagecache\_delete\_internal() when deleting block that was flushed by another thread (fixed bug when block->next\_used was unexpectedly null)
      * Fixed some using uninitialized memory warnings found by valgrind.
    * [Revision #2643.105.30](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.105.30)
      * Added option BACKUP\_ALL to mysqld `--myisam-recover` to also get a backup of the index file before it's repaired.
      * Removed wrong call to translog\_buffer\_unlock() that caused 'unlocking not locked mutex' failure in Aria log handler.
* [Revision #2884](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2884)
  * fix for [Bug #673634](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/673634):
  * better MYSQL\_PLUGIN\_WITHOUT that works correctly in all of the following:
    * `--with-plugin-XXX`
    * `--without-plugin-XXX`
    * `--with-plugins=XXX`
    * `--with-plugins=META`
    * `--with-plugins=XXX --without-plugin-XXX`
    * `--with-plugins=META --without-plugin-XXX`
