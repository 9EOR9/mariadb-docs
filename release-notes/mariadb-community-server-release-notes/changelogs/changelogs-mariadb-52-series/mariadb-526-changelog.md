  Tue 2011-05-10 18:19:11 +0200
  * small enhancement of the create table options feature:
  * no unnecessary casting from void\*, more type safety.
  * typos fixed.
* [Revision #2966](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2966)\

  Tue 2011-05-10 18:00:28 +0200
  * Cygwin-specific klugde to workaround missing TEMP/TMP variables.
* [Revision #2964](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2964) \[merge]\
  Mon 2011-05-09 15:09:40 +0200
  * Automatic merge [Mariadb 5.1](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md)->5.2.
    * [Revision #2643.127.9](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.127.9)\
      Mon 2011-05-09 15:06:16 +0200
      * Fix buildbot failure in rpl\_stop\_slave.test.
      * Problem was setting DEBUG\_SYNC twice in a row too fast in the test case;\
        this could cause the second setting to override the first before the code\
        had time to react to the first, causing the signal to get lost.
      * Fixed by waiting for the code to receive the first signal before\
        overwriting it in the test case.
* [Revision #2963](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2963)\
  Mon 2011-05-09 15:14:04 +0300
  * Make event stop code even more robust.
  * (Test failed if we added my\_sleep(200000) in event\_queue::cond\_wait() just before pthread\_cond\_wait(); Not likely scenario but better to get that fixed too)

          Wed 2011-05-04 15:45:39 +0200
          * Avoid mtr warning on Windows during startup
          * The reason for mtr warning is that collect\_mysqld\_features() starts mysqld with `--datadir=/tmp` and this\
            directory does not exist on Windows.
          * Fix : instead of passing `--datadir=$opt_vardir/tmp` in collect\_mysqld\_features() just use `--datadir=`.\
            mysqld does not need a correct directory, just an existing one, as it is started with `--help` `---verbose` `--skip-grant-tables`.

  * [Bug #686006](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/686006) : maria recovery tests fail.
  * All failing cases were attempts to use connection after\
    the server was brought down and restarted. Connections\
    used client reconnect option.
  * The reason for failures is the behavior of sockets on Windows:\
    for a short period after crash (short enough to make the error\
    not reproducible under debugger), write to socket on client\
    side would succeed but subsequent read would fail.
  * MYSQL\_OPT\_RECONNECT does not really help in this case ,\
    because in the case given here ,as mysql\_real\_query()\
    (which can handle reconnect option) succeeds and\
    mysql\_read\_results() (can't handle reconnect) fails.
  * The fix is adding `--include` wait\_until\_connected\_again.inc to\
    appropriate places in test. This ensures that read errors are\
    caught and connection is recreated.

  * CMake fixes for buildbot/MSI package building and signing:
    * FIND\_PROGRAM (signtool) will now get a hint about location of signtool.exe (Windows SDK)
    * Targets "package" or "msi" will now fail, l if signing is requested but does not work\
      (e.g invalid certificate)
    * During install, do not re-sign binaries, if they are already signed.
    * Preserve mysqld\_error.h timestamp whenever possible. This helps avoiding situations\
      where the whole server is rebuilt, whenever comp\_err.exe changes (for example after code\

      * [Bug #688404](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/688404) : Fix pbxt crashes on Windows 64 in debug build
      * The reason for the crash is misalignment on SSE instruciton\
        in setjmp(). The root cause is PBXT debug malloc(), which\
        unlike OS malloc does not guarantee 16 bytes alignment.
      * So the fix for now is disable PBXT debug malloc on Windows.\
        It was obsolete anyway, as it does not provide additional\
        benefits to C runtime debug routines (always used in debug\
        compilation) or to pageheap, available at runtime.

        binary path is "path\to\mysqld.exe" "MySQL". Guess data\
        directory it is either from my.ini (which is assumed to\
