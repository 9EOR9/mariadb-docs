* [Revision #3019](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3019)\
  Tue 2011-08-16 19:01:31 +0300
  * Fixed wrong testcase
* [Revision #3018](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3018)\
  Tue 2011-08-16 13:28:20 +0300
  * Fixed build failure in embedded library regarding that decrease\_user\_connections() was not declared
* [Revision #3017](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3017)\
  Tue 2011-08-16 13:06:07 +0300
  * If mysqld `--log-warnings=3` or higher, then print all check and repair warnings for MyISAM tables to the log.
  * This is useful when trying to find out why an automatic myisam repair failes.
* [Revision #3016](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3016)\
  Tue 2011-08-16 12:32:06 +0300
  * Fixed bug that `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` was not working properly in all situations (which could cause aborted connects)\
    thd->user\_connect is now handled in `thd->clenup()` which will ensure that it works in all context (including slaves).
  * I added also some `DBUG_ASSERT()` to ensure that things are working correctly.
* [Revision #3015](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3015)\
  Mon 2011-08-15 23:53:55 +0300
  * Fixed recovery crash [Bug #814806](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/814806) "Unclean shutdown corrupted Aria table blocking startup"
* [Revision #3014](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3014) \[merge]\
  Mon 2011-08-15 20:42:29 +0300
  * Merge in bug fix from 5.1
    * [Revision #2643.127.34](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.127.34)\
      Mon 2011-08-15 20:38:21 +0300
      * Fixed [Bug #826377](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/826377) "Aria DB Format: Reading specific table from dump causes Wrong bytesec"
      * The bug was that when using bulk insert combined with lock table, we intitalized the io cache with the wrong file position.
      * This fixed a bug where MariaDB could not read in a table dump done with mysqldump.
* [Revision #3013](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3013)\
  Mon 2011-08-15 20:40:13 +0300

  Mon 2011-08-15 16:39:53 +0300
  * Fixes bugs found by testcase for [Bug #815022](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/815022) and [Bug #726374](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/726374) "ma\_blockrec.c:3000: write\_block\_record: Assertion \`cur\_block\[1].page\_count == 0' failed with a multi-index Aria workload"
  * The issues was:
    * For some tables with a lot of not packed fields, we didn't allocate enough memory in head page which caused DBUG\_ASSERT's
    * Removed wrong `DBUG_ASSERT()`
    * Fixed a problem with underflow() where it generates a key page where all keys didn't fit.
    * Max key length is now limited by `block_size/3` (was `block_size /2`). This is required for underflow() to work with packed keys.
* [Revision #3011](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3011) \[merge]\
  Fri 2011-08-12 15:51:05 +0300

    * Replaced old DBUG\_ASSERT with a new correct one + a comment.
* [Revision #3009](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3009)\
  Wed 2011-08-10 13:08:19 +0300
  * Fixes MySQL bug#48972: `mysqldump --insert-ignore` leaves set unique\_checks=0.
  * This fixes a bug that when you use `mysqldump --no-create-info` to generate a dump that you want to merge with an existing table,\
    you can get an innodb table with duplicated unique keys.
  * Patch orignally by Eric Bergen.
* [Revision #3008](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3008)\

    * [Revision #2643.127.32](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.127.32)\
      Sun 2011-07-31 22:25:37 +0200
      * Speed up mysql-test-run.pl.
      * Problem was the parsing of test suite files for various tags and options.\
        This was done inefficiently, and include files were re-parsed for every\
        place they were included. This caused a delay of 20 seconds or so before\
        the first test started to run.
      * By parsing more efficiently and re-using first parse for subsequent\
        inclusion of the same file, time spent parsing is reduced to less than\
        1 second, and start appears instantaneous.
      * (With this patch, full ./mtr runs in 3 minutes on my laptop (release\
        build.)
* [Revision #3005](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/3005) \[merge]\

        Sun 2011-07-24 01:27:48 -0700
        * Ensure that the last `--datadir` option is used from the my.cnf files.
      * [Revision #2643.127.30](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.2/revision/2643.127.30)\
        Sun 2011-07-24 01:25:28 -0700
        * Fixes [Bug #805930](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/805930) Sysbench breaks on multiple table test with [MariaDB 5.2.7](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/mariadb-527-release-notes.md) + Aria\
          The bug happens when one uses `MAX_ROWS=#` with Aria & row\_format=page and one insert more than `#` rows.

      * Fix of [Bug #777809](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/777809)
      * There are 2 volatile condition constructions `AND/OR` constructions and fields(references) when first\
        good supported to be top elements of conditions because it is normal practice\
        (see copy\_andor\_structure for example) fields without any expression in the condition is really rare\
        and mostly useless case however it could lead to problems when optimiser changes/moves them unaware\
        of other variables referring to them. An easy solution of this problem is just to replace single field\
        in a condition with equivalent expression well supported by the server (`<field> -> <field> != 0`).
