**Release date:** 26 July 2011

* [Revision #3069](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3069)\
  Wed 2011-06-29 16:05:16 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #803410](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/803410).\
    Due to this bug in the function generate\_derived\_keys\_for\_table some\
    key definitions to access materialized derived tables or materialized\
    views were constructed with invalid info for their key parts.\
    This could make the server crash when it optimized queries using\
    materialized derived tables or materialized views.
* [Revision #3068](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3068) \[merge]\
  Tue 2011-06-28 19:56:30 -0700
  * Merge.
  * [Revision #3065.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3065.1.1)\
    Tue 2011-06-28 18:31:54 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #802860](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/802860).\
      This crashing bug could manifest itself at execution of join queries\
      over materialized derived tables with IN subquery predicates in the\
      where clause. If for such a query the optimizer chose to use duplicate\
      weed-out with duplicates in a materialized derived table and chose to\
      employ join cache the the execution could cause a crash of the server.\
      It happened because the JOIN\_CACHE::init method assumed that the value\
      of TABLE::file::ref is set at the moment when the method was called\
      for the employed join cache. It's true for regular tables, but it's\
      not true for materialized derived tables that are filled now at the\
      first access to them, i.e. after the JOIN\_CACHE::init has done its job.
    * To fix this problem for any ROWID field of materialized derived table\
      the procedure that copies fields from record buffers into the employed\
      join buffer first checks whether the value of TABLE::file::ref has\
      been set for the table, and if it's not so the procedure sets this value.
* [Revision #3067](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3067)\
  Tue 2011-06-28 15:48:44 +0300
  * Fixed [Bug #800679](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800679)
    * Analysis:
      * The failed assert ensured that the choice of subquery strategy\
        is performed only for queries with at least one table. If there\
        is a LIMIT 0 clause all tables are removed, and the subquery is\
        neither optimized, nor executed during actual optimization. However,\
        if the query is EXPLAIN-ed, the EXPLAIN execution path doesn't remove\
        the query tables if there is a LIMIT 0 clause. As a result, the\
        subquery optimization code is called, which violates the ASSERT\
        condition.
    * Solution:
      * Transform the assert into a condition, and if the outer query\
        has no tables assume that there will be at most one subquery\
        execution.
      * There is potentially a better solution by reengineering the\
        EXPLAIN/optimize code, so that subquery optimization is not\
        done if not needed. Such a solution would be a lot bigger and\
        more complex than a bug fix.
* [Revision #3066](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3066)\
  Tue 2011-06-28 11:11:26 +0400
  * [MySQL Bug #751484](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=751484): Valgrind warning / sporadic crash in evaluate\_join\_record sql\_select.cc:14099 with semijoin
    * Added testcase. The bug is most likely fixed by [MWL#90](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=90) code.
* [Revision #3065](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3065) \[merge]\
  Mon 2011-06-27 23:36:20 -0700
  * Merge
  * [Revision #3062.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3062.2.1)\
    Mon 2011-06-27 23:07:46 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #800535](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800535).\
      The function create\_view\_field in some cases incorrectly set the maybe\_null\
      flag for the returned items.
* [Revision #3064](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3064) \[merge]\
  Tue 2011-06-28 00:18:42 +0300

    * Automatic merge
      * [Revision #3061.1.4](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3061.1.4)\
        Mon 2011-06-27 19:30:05 +0300
        * Added mytop to distribution (with some small trivial changes to make it workg good also for MariaDB)
      * [Revision #3061.1.3](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3061.1.3)\
        Mon 2011-06-27 19:07:24 +0300
        * New status variables: Rows\_tmp\_read, Handler\_tmp\_update and Handler\_tmp\_write\
          Split status variable Rows\_read to Rows\_read and Rows\_tmp\_read so that one can see how much real data is read.\
          Same was done with with Handler\_update and Handler\_write.\
          Fixed bug in MEMORY tables where some variables was counted twice.\
          Added new internal handler call 'ha\_close()' to have one place to gather statistics.\
          Fixed bug where thd->open\_options was set to wrong value when doing admin\_recreate\_table()
      * [Revision #3061.1.2](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3061.1.2)\
        Mon 2011-06-27 12:51:13 +0300
        * Updated version tag to beta

          * [Revision #3039.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3039.1.1)\
            Mon 2011-06-13 14:07:44 +0300
            * Added test case to show that we get a warning from CHECK TABLE if we force auto\_increment value to 0
* [Revision #3063](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3063)\
  Mon 2011-06-27 23:38:56 +0400
  * Added TODO comments
* [Revision #3062](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3062)\
  Sun 2011-06-26 21:55:32 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #801536](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/801536).\
    Ensured valid calculations of the estimates stored in JOIN\_TAB::used\_fieldlength.
* [Revision #3061](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3061)\
  Sat 2011-06-25 14:02:27 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #802023](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/802023).\
    Made mergeable views and mergeable derived tables transparent for\
    the MIN/MAX optimization.
* [Revision #3060](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3060)\
  Fri 2011-06-24 21:18:20 -0700
  * Added test cases for [Bug #798625](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/798625) and [Bug #800085](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800085)\
    fixed by the patch for [Bug #798621](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/798621).
* [Revision #3059](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3059)\
  Fri 2011-06-24 18:42:14 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #799499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/799499).\
    The following were missing in the patch for mwl106:
    * KEY\_PART\_INFO::fieldnr were not set for generated keys to access\
      tmp tables storing the rows of materialized derived tables/views
    * TABLE\_SHARE::column\_bitmap\_size was not set for tmp tables storing\
      the rows of materialized derived tables/views.
    * These could cause crashes or memory overwrite.
* [Revision #3058](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3058)\
  Fri 2011-06-24 14:38:53 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #798576](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/798576).\
    If a view/derived table is non-mergeable then the definition of the tmp table\
    to store the rows for it is created at the prepare stage. In this case if the\
    view definition uses outer joins and a view column belongs to an inner table\
    of one of them then the column should be considered as nullable independently\
    on nullability of the underlying column. If the underlying column happens to be\
    defined as non-nullable then the function create\_tmp\_field\_from\_item rather\
    than the function create\_tmp\_field\_from\_field should be employed to create\
    the definition of the interesting column in the tmp table.
* [Revision #3057](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3057) \[merge]\
  Fri 2011-06-24 21:43:31 +0400
  * Merge 5.2 -> 5.3\
    (testcase for [Bug #798597](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/798597) now crashes)
* [Revision #3056](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3056)\
  Thu 2011-06-23 22:12:22 -0700
  * Fixed a valgrind problem.\
    The function setup\_tables should handle table\_list elements for\
    semijoin materialized tables in a special way when executing\
    a prepared statement for the second time.
* [Revision #3055](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3055)\
  Thu 2011-06-23 14:48:45 -0700
  * Fixed [Bug #800518](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800518).\
    The function simple\_pred did not take into account that a multiple equality\
    could include ref items (more exactly items of the class Item\_direct\_view\_ref).\
    It caused crashes for queries over derived tables or views if the\
    min/max optimization could be applied to these queries.
* [Revision #3054](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3054) \[merge]\
  Tue 2011-06-21 18:17:28 -0700
  * Merge
  * [Revision #3052.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3052.1.1)\
    Tue 2011-06-21 18:00:58 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #798621](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/798621).
    * The patch for [Bug #717577](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/717577) and [Bug #724942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/724942) has missed to make adjustments for the\
      call item\_equal->add\_const(const\_item, orig\_field\_item) in the function\
      check\_simple\_equality that builds multiple equality for a field and a constant.\
      As a result, when this field happens to be a view field and the corresponding\
      Item\_field object F is wrapped in an Item\_direct\_view\_ref object R the object\
      F is placed in the multiple equality instead of the object R.\
      A substitution of an equal item for F potentially can cause very serious\
      problems and in some cases can lead to crashes of the server.
* [Revision #3053](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3053)\
  Tue 2011-06-21 23:01:01 +0300
  * [MWL#89](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=89)\

    Tue 2011-06-21 15:50:07 +0300
    * [MWL#89](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=89)
      * Added regression test with queries over the WORLD database.
      * Discovered and fixed several bugs in the related cost calculation\
        functionality both in the semijoin and non-semijon subquery code.
      * Added DBUG printing of the cost variables used to decide between\
        IN-EXISTS and MATERIALIZATION.
* [Revision #3051](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3051)\
  Fri 2011-06-17 23:00:26 +0200

    Wed 2011-06-15 18:37:01 +0400
    * [Bug #778406](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/778406): Crash in hp\_movelink with Aria engine and subqueries\
      -In do\_sj\_dups\_weedout(), set nulls\_ptr to point to NULL bytes (and not to length bytes) of the DuplicateWeedout column.

  * Merge of mwl #106 into 5.3.
  * [Revision #3025.1.5](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3025.1.5)\
    Thu 2011-06-09 12:43:28 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #794909](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/794909).
      * The function generate\_derived\_keys did not take into account the fact\
        that the last element in the array of keyuses could be just a barrier\
        element. In some cases it could lead to a crash of the server.
    * Also fixed a couple of other bugs in generate\_derived\_keys: the inner\
      loop in the body of if this function did not change the cycle variables\
      properly.
  * [Revision #3025.1.4](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3025.1.4)\
    Thu 2011-06-09 00:13:00 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #794038](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/794038).\
      INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement that used a temptable view v1 could lead to\
      a crash if v1 was defined as a select from a mergeable view v2 that selected\
      rows from a temptable view v3.
    * When INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE uses a view that is not updatable then field\
      translation for the view should be created before the prepare phase.
  * [Revision #3025.1.3](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3025.1.3)\
    Mon 2011-06-06 12:19:35 -0700
    * Fixed [Bug #793436](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/793436)
      * When looking for the execution plan of a derived table to be materialized\
        JOIN::optimize finds out that all joined tables of the derived table\
        contain not more than one row then the derived table should be maretialized\
        at the optimization stage.
      * Added a test case for the bug.
      * Adjusted results in other test cases.
  * [Revision #3025.1.2](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3025.1.2)\
    Sun 2011-06-05 21:54:25 -0700
    * Added two new flags for the optimizer switch:
      * 'derived\_merge':
        * if the flag is off then all derived tables are materialized
        * if the flag is on then mergeable derived tables are merged
      * 'derived\_with\_keys':
        * if the flag is off then no keys are created for derived tables
        * if the flag is on then for any derived table a key to access\
          the derived table may be created.
      * Now by default both flags are on.\
        Later the default values for the flags will be off to comply with\
        the current behaviour of mysql-5.1.
      * Uncommented previously commented out test case from parts.partition\_repair\_myisam\
        after having added an explicit requirement to materialize the derived\
        table used in the test case.

  * Another attempt at fixing the rare random failures of rpl\_corruption
  * The previous patch partially fixed things by waiting for the old dump thread\
    on the master to exit before injecting the DBUG error. This prevents the error\
    injection going to the wrong thread.
  * However, there is still the problem that the old dump thread may never exit,\
    causing the wait to time out. This happens if the dump thread manages to write\
    all events down the socket before the socket is closed by the slave. The\
    master dump thread only checks for slave gone when writing a new event, so if\
    no new events are generated, old dump threads can hang around forever on the\
    master after the slave disconnects.
  * Fix by explicitly killing the old dump thread if it is still around.

    * Attempt to fix rpl.rpl\_corruption failure seen in Buildbot on Windows.
    * There is a potential race when we stop the slave. It may take some time for\
      the master to detect that the slave connection is closed (eg. if scheduling\
      delays the TCP RSET packet or whatever). Since we inject only a single corrupt\
      binlog event, we may be unfortunate enough to inject it on the wrong\
      connection, to a slave io thread that's already stopped.
    * Fix by waiting for the old dump thread on the master to go away before\
      injecting the corrupt event.

  * Eliminated the member original\_cond from the class SQL\_SELECT\
    introduced at the latest merge 5.1->5.2->5.3.\
    It is basically not needed since if SQL\_SELECT::pre\_idx\_push\_select\_cond\
    is not NULL then SQL\_SELECT::original\_cond would point to the same condition\
    as SQL\_SELECT::pre\_idx\_push\_select\_cond. Otherwise SQL\_SELECT::original\_cond\
    would be equal to SQL\_SELECT::cond.
