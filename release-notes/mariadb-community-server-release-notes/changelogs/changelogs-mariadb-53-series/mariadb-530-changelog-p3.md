        * Fixed [Bug #777745](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/777745)
        * Fields belonging to views in general cannot be substituted for\
          equal items, in particular for constants, because all references\
          to a view field refer to the same Item\_field object while they\
          could be used in different OR parts of the where condition and\
          belong to different equivalence classes (to different Item\_equals).\
          That's why substitution for equal items in any context is allowed\
          only in place of Item\_direct\_view\_ref objects, but not in place of\
          Item\_fields these objects refer to.\
          Due to some erroneous code in the patch for [Bug #717577](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/717577) substitution\
          for view fields were allowed in some context.This could lead
        * The fix prohibits substitution of view fields for equal items\
          in any context.
        * The patch also changes slightly the compile method for the Item\_func\
          class. Now if the analyze method returns NULL in his parameter the\
          compile method is not called for the arguments of the function\
          at all. A similar change was made for the Item\_ref class.

    * Analysis:\
      The method st\_select\_lex::optimize\_unflattened\_subqueries()\
      incorrectly propagated to each subquery the complete\
      select\_options flag set for the whole query. Among other\
      flags in select\_options, this propagated incorrectly the\
      STRAIGHT\_JOIN flag from the upper query to the subquery.
    * Solution:\
      During EXPLAIN set only the SELECT\_DESCRIBE bit in the\
      select\_options of the subquery.

      the specification explicitly required to do so from any table access\
      plan once the plan provided a better upper bound for the number of\
      rows selected from the table. It resulted in a bogus, usually very\
      big number saved as the cost of the table access. This, in its turn,\
      in many cases forced the optimizer to make a bad choice of the\
      execution plan for join queries.

    * Fixed [Bug #717577](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/717577), [Bug #724942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/724942):
      * Both these two bugs happened due to the following problem.\
        When a view column is referenced in the query an Item\_direct\_view\_ref\
        object is created that is refers to the Item\_field for the column.\
        All references to the same view column refer to the same Item\_field.\
        Different references can belong to different AND/OR levels and,\
        as a result, can be included in different Item\_equal object.\
        These Item\_equal objects may include different constant objects.\
        If these constant objects are substituted for the Item\_field created\
        for a view column we have a conflict situation when the second\
        substitution annuls the first substitution. This leads to\
        wrong result sets returned by the query. [Bug #724942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/724942) demonstrates\
        such an erroneous behaviour.
      * Test case of the [Bug #717577](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/717577) produces wrong result sets because best\
        equal fields of the multiple equalities built for different OR levels\
        of the WHERE condition differs. The subsitution for the best equal field\
        in the second OR branch overwrites the the substitution made for the\
        first branch.
      * To avoid such conflicts we have to substitute for the references\
        to the view columns rather than for the underlying field items.\
        To make such substitutions possible we have to include into\
        multiple equalities references to view columns rather than\
        field items created for such columns.
      * This patch modifies the Item\_equal class to include references\
        to view columns into multiple equality objects. It also performs\
        a clean up of the class methods and adds more comments. The methods\
        of the Item\_direct\_view\_ref class that assist substitutions for\
        references to view columns has been also added by this patch.

  * Merge various replication-related patches into [MariaDB 5.3](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md):
    * [MWL#116](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=116) Group commit
    * [MWL#136](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=136) Enhancements for START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT

    * [MWL#116](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=116): After-review fixes.
    * Also implement the InnoDB changes for group commit into innodb\_plugin.
  * [Revision #2732.26.16](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2732.26.16)\
    Thu 2011-04-07 12:41:49 +0200
    * Change lock release to assert in XtraDB commit\_ordered(); we never want to\
      hold the latch across the 2-phase commit, and it is already released at\
      start of prepare (if not before).
    * Rename trx->active\_trans to active\_flag; since we changed the semantics of\
      the field, renaming should help prevent silent merge errors.

    * Merge [MWL#116](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=116), PBXT part into mariadb-5.2-rpl
    * This makes PBXT implement the commit\_ordered() method, so that cross-engine\

      XtraDB.
    * Also mark the version number to show this is the -rpl feature preview.

    * Make EXPLAIN better at displaying MRR/BKA:
      * "Using MRR" is no longer shown with range access.
      * Instead, both range and BKA accesses will show one of the following:
        * \= "Rowid-ordered scan"
        * \= "Key-ordered scan"
        * \= "Key-ordered Rowid-ordered scan"
      * depending on whether DS-MRR implementation will do scan keys in order, rowids in order,\
        or both.
      * The patch also introduces a way for other storage engines/MRR implementations to\
        pass information to EXPLAIN output about the properties of employed MRR scans.

    * Fix [Bug #613029](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/613029)
    * Analysis:
      * There are two code paths through which JOIN::exec may produce\
        an all-NULL row for an empty result set. One goes via the\
        function return\_zero\_rows(), when query processing detectes\
        early that the where clause is false, the other one is via\
        do\_select() in the case of join execution.
      * In the case of do\_select(), the problem was that the executioner\
        didn't set TABLE::null\_row to 1. As result when sending the only\
        result row, the evaluation of each field didn't detect that all\
        non-aggregated fields are NULL, because Field::is\_null returned\
        true, after checking that field->table->null\_row was false.
      * Given that the each non-aggregated field was not considered NULL,\
        select\_result::send\_data sent whatever was in the buffer of each\
        field. However, since there was no actual data in the field buffer,\
        send\_data() accessed and sent whatever junk was in the field's\
        data buffer.
    * Solution:
      * Similar to the analogous case in return\_zero\_rows() mark all\
        tables that their current row is NULL before sending the\
        artificailly created NULL row.

  Thu 2011-03-24 16:34:06 +0200
  * Fix [Bug #715738](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/715738)
    * Analysis:
      * A query with implicit grouping is one with aggregate functions and\
        no GROUP BY clause. MariaDB inherits from MySQL an SQL extenstion\
        that allows mixing aggregate functions with non-aggregate fields.\
        If a query with such mixed select clause produces an empty result\
        set, the meaning of aggregate functions is well defined - either\
        NULL (MIN, MAX, etc.), or 0 (count(\*)). However the non-aggregated\
        fields must also have some value, and the only reasonable value in\
        the case of empty result is NULL.
      * The cause of the many wrong results was that if a field is declared\
        as non-nullable (e.g. because it is a PK or NOT NULL), the semantic\
        analysis and the optimization phases treat this field as non-nullable,\
        and generate all related query plan elements based on this assumption.
      * Later during execution, these incorrectly configured/generated query\
        plan elements result in a wrong result because the selected fields\
        are not null due to the not-null assumption during optimization.
    * Solution:
      * Detect before the context analysys phase that a query uses implicit\
        grouping with mixed aggregates/non-aggregates, and set all fields\
        as nullable. The parser already walks the SELECT clause, and\
        already sets Item::with\_sum\_func for Items that reference aggreagate\
        functions. The patch adds a symmetric Item::with\_field so that all\
        Items that reference an Item\_field are marked during their\
        construction at parse time in the same way as with aggregate function\
        use.
