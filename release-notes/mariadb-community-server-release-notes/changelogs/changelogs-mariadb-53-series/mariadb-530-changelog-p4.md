  * [Revision #2928.3.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2928.3.1)\
    Thu 2011-03-03 18:24:41 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #702322](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/702322):\
      The bug was a result of the fix for [Bug #668644](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/668644) that turned out to be\
      not quite correct. A problem appeared with HAVING conditions containing\
      more than one predicate. If a query with an ORDER BY clause uses\
      such HAVING condition and the required order can be obtained with\
      a range/index scan then the HAVING condition has to be pushed into\
      two different formulas (items). To be able to do it we have to create\
      a copy of the ANDOR structure of the pushed condition.

  * Merge in the fix for [Bug #730604](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/730604), and a corrected fix for [Bug #719198](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/719198),\
    after Monty's review.
  * [Revision #2933.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2933.2.1)\
    Sun 2011-03-13 15:03:26 +0000
    * Fix [Bug #719198](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/719198), [Bug #730604](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/730604)
    * Analysis ( [Bug #719198](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/719198) ):
      * The assert failed because the execution code for\
        partial matching is designed with the assumption that\
        NULLs on the left side are detected as early as possible,\
        and a NULL result is returned before any lookups are\
        performed at all.
      * However, in the case of an Item\_cache object on the left\
        side, null was not detected properly, because detection\
        was done via Item::is\_null(), which is not implemented at\
        all for Item\_cache, and resolved to the default Item::is\_null()\
        which always returns FALSE.
    * Solution:
      * Imlpement Item::is\_null().
    * Analysis ( [Bug #730604](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/730604) ):
      * The method Item\_field::is\_null() determines if an item is NULL from its\
        Item\_field::field object. However, for Item\_fields that represent internal\
        temporary tables, Item\_field::field represents the field of the original\
        table that was the source for the temporary table (in this case t1.f3).\
        Both in the committed test case, and in the original bug report the current\
        value of t1.f3 is not NULL. This results in an incorrect count of NULLs\
        for this column. As a consequence, all related Ordered\_key buffers are\
        allocated with incorrect sizes. Depending on the exact query and data,\
        these incorrect sizes result in various crashes or failed asserts.
    * Solution:
      * The correct value of the current field of the internal temp table is\
        in Item\_field::result\_field. This value is determined by\
        Item::is\_null\_result().

  * [Revision #2933.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2933.1.1)\
    Mon 2011-03-07 22:09:21 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #729039](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/729039):\
      If join condition is of the form \<t2.key>=\<t1.no\_key> then the server\
      performs no index look-ups when looking for matching rows of t2 for\
      the rows from t1 with t1.no\_key=NULL. It happens because the function\
      add\_not\_null\_conds() injects an additional condition of the form\
      IS NOT NULL(\<t1.no\_key>) into the WHERE condition.\
      However if the join condition was of the form \<t.key>=\<outer\_ref> no\
      additional null rejecting predicate was generated. This could lead\
      to extra records in the result set if the value of \<outer\_ref> happened\
      to be NULL.
    * The new code injects null rejecting predicates of the form\
      IS NOT NULL(\<outer\_ref>) and evaluates them before the first row\
      the subquery is constructed.

        is properly updated for Item\_cache objects as well.

    * [Bug #693747](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/693747): Assertion multi\_range\_read.cc:908: int DsMrr\_impl::dsmrr\_init
      * Make DsMrr\_impl::dsmrr\_init() handle the case of
        1. 1st MRR scan using DS-MRR strategy (i.e. doing key sorting and rowid sorting)
        2. 2nd MRR scan getting a buffer that's too small to fit one key element\
           and one rowid element, and so falling back to default MRR implementation
      * In this case, dsmrr\_init() is invoked with {primary\_handler, secondary\_handler}\
        initialized for DS-MRR scan and have to reset them to be initialized for the\
        default MRR scan.

    Fri 2011-03-04 00:54:10 +0300
    * [Bug #707925](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/707925): Wrong result with join\_cache\_level=6 optimizer\_use\_mrr = force (incremental, BKA join)
      * The problem was that Mrr\_ordered\_index\_reader's interrupt\_read() and resume\_read() would\
        save and restore 1) index tuple 2) the rowid (as bytes returned by handler->position()). Clustered\
        primary key columns were not saved/restored.
      * They are not explicitly present in the index tuple (i.e. table->key\_info\[secondary\_key].key\_parts\
        doesn't list them), but they are actually there, in particular\
        table->field\[clustered\_primary\_key\_member].part\_of\_key(secondary\_key) == 1. Index condition pushdown\
        code \[correctly] uses the latter as inidication that pushed index condition can refer to clustered PK\
        members.
      * The fix was to make interrupt\_read()/resume\_read() to save/restore clustered primary key members as well,\
        so that we get correct values for them when evaluating pushed index condition.
    * \[3rd attempt: remove the debugging aids, fix comments in testcase]
* [Revision #2929](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2929)\
  Thu 2011-03-03 23:48:31 +0200
  * Fix [Bug #718763](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/718763)
    * Analysis:
      * The reason for the crash was that the inner subquery was executed\
        via a scan on a final temporary table applied after all other\
        operations. This final operation is implemented by changing the\
        contents of the JOIN object of the subquery to represent a table\
        scan over the temp table. At the same time query optimization of\
        the outer subquery required evaluation of the inner subquery, which\
        happened before the actual EXPLAIN. The evaluation left the JOIN\
        object of the inner subquery in the changed state, where it represented\
        a table scan over a temp table, and EXPLAIN crashed because the temp\
        table is not associated with any table reference (TABLE\_LIST object).\
        The reason the JOIN was not restored was because its saving/restoration\
        was controlled by the join->select\_lex->uncacheable flag, which was\
        not set in the case of materialization.
    * Solution:
      * In the methods Item\_in\_subselect::\[single | row]\_value\_transformer() set:\
        select\_lex->uncacheable|= UNCACHEABLE\_EXPLAIN;
      * In addition, for symmetry, change:\
        master\_unit->uncacheable|= UNCACHEABLE\_EXPLAIN;
      * instead of UNCACHEABLE\_DEPENDENT because if a subquery was not\
        dependent initially, the changed methods do not change this\
        fact. The subquery may later become correlated if it is transformed\
        to an EXISTS query, but it may stay uncorrelated if executed via\
        materialization.

  Sun 2011-02-27 22:37:46 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #725050](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/725050):\
    The bug in the function print\_keyuse() caused crashes if\
    hash join could be used. It happened because the function\
    ignored the fact that KEYUSE structures could be created\
    for hash joins as well.

    * BNLH algorithm always used a full table scan over the joined table\
      even in the cases when there existed range/index-merge scans that\
      were cheaper than the full table scan.
    * This was a defect/bug of the implementation of mwl #128.\
      Now hash join can work not only with full table scan of the joined\
      table, but also with full index scan, range and index-merge scans.
    * Accordingly, in the cases when hash join is used the column 'type'\
      in the EXPLAINs can contain now 'hash\_ALL', 'hash\_index', 'hash\_range'\
      and 'hash\_index\_merge'. If hash join is coupled with a range/index\_merge\
      scan then the columns 'key' and 'key\_len' contain info not only on\
      the used hash index, but also on the indexes used for the scan.

  * Fix [MySQL Bug #60057](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60057) : sel\_arg\_range\_seq\_next loops in optimized compilation/VS2010
    * When [mariadb 5.3](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-53-series/broken-reference/README.md) is compiler with VS2010, several tests would enter infinite loop in\
      sel\_arg\_range\_seq\_next(). The reason is compiler backend bug. This bug is not\
      present in either VS2008 or VS2010 SP1 RC.
    * Workaround is to compile this function without most aggresive optimization flag\
      (-Og ) using #pragma optimize ("g", {on|off}) for this version of MSVC compiler.

    * Introduced optimizer switch flag 'optimize\_join\_buffer\_size'.
    * When this flag is 'off' the size of the used join buffer\
      is taken directly from the system variable 'join\_buffer\_size'.
    * When this flag is 'on' then the size of the buffer depends\
      on the estimated number of rows in the partial join whose\
      records are to be stored in the buffer.
    * By default this flag is set 'on'.

    * Fixed [Bug #702403](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/702403) that caused a crash on the tree for [MWL#128](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=128)\
      with the test case added by this patch.
    * The bug cannot be reproduced with the same test case for the main\
      5.3 tree because the backported fix for [MySQL Bug #59696](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59696) masks the\
      problem that causes the crash in the mentioned test case. It's not\
      clear weather this fix masks this problem in all possible cases.
    * Anyway the patch for [Bug #698882](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/698882) introduced some inconsistent data\
      structures that could contain indirect references to deleted object.
    * It happened when two Item\_equal objects were merged and the Item\_field\
      list of the second object was joined to such list of the first object.
    * This operation required adjustment of the backward pointers in\
      Item fields from the joined list. However the adjustment was missing\
      and this caused crashes in the tree for [MWL#128](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=128).
    * Now the backward pointers are set only when Item\_equal items are\
      completely built and are not changed anymore.

  * Back-ported the patch for [MySQL Bug #59696](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59696) from mysql-5.6 code line.
  * The patch fixed the following optimizer defect: when performing\
    substitution for best equal fields into where conditions to be\
    able to do their evaluations as soon as possible the optimizer\
    skipped conditions over views. That could lead to suboptimal\
    execution of queries that used views.
  * Slightly changed the test case to demonstrate the performance\
    improvements if this fix.

  Thu 2011-01-27 21:23:02 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #707827](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/707827).
    * This bug could manifest itself when hash join over a varchar column\
      with NULL values in some rows was used. It happened because the\
      function key\_buf\_cmp erroneously returned FALSE when one of the joined\
      key fields was null while the second was not.
    * Also fixed two other bugs in the functions key\_hashnr and key\_buf\_cmp\
      that could possibly lead to wrong results for some queries that\
      used hash join over several columns with nulls.
    * Also reverted the latest addition of the test case for [MySQL Bug #45092](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45092). It\
      had been already backported earlier.
* [Revision #2895](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2895)\
  Wed 2011-01-26 20:45:23 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #707848](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/707848).
    * This was another bug in the patch for [Bug #698882](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/698882). The new\
      code from this patch did not ensured that substitutions\
      of fields for best equal fields were performed on all\
      AND-OR levels. As a result substitutions for best fields\
      in some predicates that had been used by the range optimizer\
      were not actually performed while range plans could employ\
      these substitutions. This could lead to inconsistent data\
      structures and ultimately to a crash.

  * Fixed [Bug #707555](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/707555).
    * The bug was in the code of the patch fixing [Bug #698882](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/698882).
    * With improper casting the method store\_key\_field::change\_source\_field\
      was called for the elements of the array TABLE\_REF::key\_copy that\
      were either of a different type or not allocated at all. This caused\
      crashes in some queries.
