* [Revision #3182](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3182)\
  Thu 2011-09-08 23:24:47 +0400
  * [Bug #833600](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/833600): Wrong result with view + outer join + uncorrelated subquery (non-semijoin)
    * The bug was caused by outer join being incorrectly converted into inner because of\
      invalid return values of Item\_direct\_view\_ref::not\_null\_tables().
    * Provided a correct Item\_direct\_view\_ref::not\_null\_tables() function.
* [Revision #3181](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3181) \[merge]\

      * [Bug #830993](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/830993): Crash in end\_read\_record with derived table
        * Let join buffering code correctly take into account rowids needed\
          by DuplicateElimination when it is calculating minimum record sizes.
        * In JOIN\_CACHE::write\_record\_data, added asserts that prevent us from\
          writing beyond the end of the buffer.
* [Revision #3180](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3180) \[merge]\

    * [Revision #3156.1.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3156.1.1)\
      Mon 2011-08-15 23:18:36 -0700
      * Fixed LP bug #824463.
      * When merging a view / derived table the function SELECT\_LEX::merge\_subquery\
        incorrectly updated the list SELECT\_LEX::leaf\_tables. Erroneously it\
        appended the leaf\_tables list of the merged object L and then removed the\
        reference to the merged object T from the SELECT\_LEX::leaf\_tables list.
      * A correct implementation should insert the list L into the\
        SELECT\_LEX::leaf\_tables list in place of the element of the list that\
        refers to T.
      * The bug could lead to wrong results or even crashes for queries with\
        nested outer joins over views / derived tables.
* [Revision #3179](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3179)\

  * [Bug #839387](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/839387) Assertion \`(Item\_result)i != TIME\_RESULT' failed with CASE + datetime
    * remove incorrect DBUG\_ASSERT().
    * Fix incorrectly used cmp\_item::get\_comparator() in Item\_func\_case and Item\_equal
* [Revision #3178](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3178) \[merge]\

      * [Bug #823930](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/823930): Wrong result with semijoin materialization and blob fields
        * Make subquery\_types\_allow\_materialization() detect a case where\
          create\_tmp\_table() would create a blob column which would make it\
          impossible to use materialization
        * Non-semi-join materialization worked because it detected that this case\
          and felt back to use IN->EXISTS. Semi-join Materialization cannot easily\
          fallback, so we have to detect this case early.

        * Don't use join buffering for tables that are within ranges that are\
          covered by LooseScan strategy.

      * [Bug #834758](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/834758): Wrong result with innner join, LooseScan, two-column IN() predicate
        * get\_bound\_sj\_equalities() would produce incorrect bitmap when non-first\
          equality was bound, which resulted in invalid LooseScan plans.

      * [Bug #836532](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/836532): Crash in Item\_equal\_fields\_iterator::get\_curr\_field with semijoin+materialization
        * Item\_in\_subselect::inject\_in\_to\_exists\_cond() should not call\
          ((Item\_cond\*)join->conds)->argument\_list()->concat(join->cond\_equal->current\_level)\
          as that makes two lists share their tail, and the cond\_equal list\
          will end up containing non-Item\_equal objects when substitute\_for\_best\_equal\_field()\
          walks through join->conds and replaces all Item\_equal objects with Item\_func\_eq objects.
        * So, instead of using List::concat(), manually copy entries from one list to another.

          quick\_index\_merge\_select->reset() may change it.

      * [Bug #836507](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/836507): Crash in setup\_sj\_materialization\_part1() with semijoin+materialization
        * setup\_sj\_materialization() code failed to take into account that it can be that\
          the first \[in join order ordering] table inside semi-join-materialization nest\
          is also an inner table wrt an outer join (that is embedded in the semi-join).\
          This can happen when all of the tables that are inside the semi-join but not inside\
          the outer join are constant.
        * Made a trivial to not assume that table's embedding join nest is the semi-join\
          nest: instead, walk up the outer join nests until we reach the semi-join nest.

    * [Revision #2732.44.28](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2732.44.28)\
      Mon 2011-09-05 09:29:49 +0300
      * Fix of [Bug #780386](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/780386).
        * ALL subquery should return TRUE if subquery rowa set is empty independently\
          of left part. The problem was that Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) do not\
          call execution of second argument if first is NULL no in this case subquery\
          will not be executed and when Item\_func\_not\_all calls any\_value() of the\
          subquery or aggregation function which report that there was rows. So for\
          NULL < ALL (SELECT...) result was FALSE instead of TRUE.
        * Fix is just swapping of arguments of Item\_func\_(eq,ne,gt,ge,lt,le) (with\
          changing the operation if it is needed) so that result will be the same\
          (for examole a < b is equal to b > a). This fix exploit the fact that\
          first argument will be executed in any case.

      * [Bug #834534](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/834534): Assertion \`0' failed in replace\_where\_subcondition with semijoin subquery in HAVING
        * The problem was that the code that made the check whether the subquery is an AND-part of the WHERE\
          clause didn't work correctly for nested subqueries. In particular, grand-child subquery in HAVING was\
          treated as if it was in the WHERE, which eventually caused an assert when replace\_where\_subcondition\
          looked for the subquery predicate in the WHERE and couldn't find it there.
        * The fix: Removed implementation of "thd\_marker approach". thd->thd\_marker was used to determine the\
          location of subquery predicate: setup\_conds() would set accordingly it when making\
          the `{where|on_expr}->fix_fields(...)`call\
          so that AND-parts of the WHERE/ON clauses can determine they are the AND-parts.\
          Item\_cond\_or::fix\_fields(), Item\_func::fix\_fields(), Item\_subselect::fix\_fields (this one was missed),\
          and all other items-that-contain-items had to reset thd->thd\_marker before calling fix\_fields() for\
          their children items, so that the children can see they are not AND-parts of WHERE/ON.\
          \* The "thd\_marker approach" required that a lot of code in different locations maintains correct value of\
          thd->thd\_marker, so it was replaced with:\
          \* The new approach with mark\_as\_condition\_AND\_part does not keep context in thd->thd\_marker. Instead,\
          setup\_conds() now calls `{where|on_expr}->mark_as_condition_AND_part()`
    * and implementations of that function make sure that:
      * parts of AND-expressions get the mark\_as\_condition\_AND\_part() call
      * Item\_in\_subselect objects record that they are AND-parts of WHERE/ON

  Thu 2011-09-01 23:53:12 +0300
  * Fix for [Bug #834492](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/834492)
  * Analysis:
    * In the test query semi-join merges the inner-most subquery\
      into the outer subquery, and the optimization of the merged\
      subquery finds some new index access methods. Later the\
      IN-EXISTS transformation is applied to the unmerged subquery.\
      Since the optimizer is instructed to not consider\
      materialization, it reoptimizes the plan in-place to take into\
      account the new IN-EXISTS conditions. Just before reoptimization\
      JOIN::choose\_subquery\_plan resets the query plan, which also\
      resets the access methods found during the semi-join merge.\
      Then reoptimization discovers there are no new access methods,\
      but it leaves the query plan in its reset state. Later semi-join\
      crashes because it assumes these access methods are present.
  * Solution:
    * When reoptimizing in-place, reset the query plan only after new\
      access methods were discovered. If no new access methods were\
      discovered, leave the current plan as it was.

  Sat 2011-08-27 00:40:29 +0300
  * Fix [Bug #827416](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/827416)
  * Analysis:
    * Constant table optimization of the outer query finds that\
      the right side of the equality is a constant that can\
      be used for an eq\_ref access to fetch one row from t1,\
      and substitute t1 with a constant. Thus constant optimization\
      triggers evaluation of the subquery during the optimize\
      phase of the outer query.
    * The innermost subquery requires a plan with a temporary\
      table because with InnoDB tables the exact count of rows\
      is not known, and the empty tables cannot be optimzied\
      way. JOIN::exec for the innermost subquery substitutes\
      the subquery tables with a temporary table.
    * When EXPLAIN gets to print the tables in the innermost\
      subquery, EXPLAIN needs to print the name of each table\
      through the corresponding TABLE\_LIST object. However,\
      the temporary table created during execution doesn't\
      have a corresponding TABLE\_LIST, so we get a null\
      pointer exception.
  * Solution:
    * The solution is to forbid using expensive constant\
      expressions for eq\_ref access for contant table\
      optimization. Notice that eq\_ref with a subquery\
      providing the value is still possible during regular\
      execution.

      * Fixed [Bug #825018](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/825018)
        * Analysis:
          * During the first execution of the query through the stored\
            procedure, the optimization phase calls\
            substitute\_for\_best\_equal\_field(), which calls\
            Item\_in\_optimizer::transform(). The latter replaces\
            Item\_in\_subselect::left\_expr with args\[0] via assignment.\
            In this test case args\[0] is an Item\_outer\_ref which is\
            created/deallocated for each re-execution. As a result,\
            during the second execution Item\_in\_subselect::left\_expr\
            pointed to freed memory, which resulted in a crash.
        * Solution:
          * The solution is to use change\_item\_tree(), so that the\
            origianal left expression is restored after each execution.

      * Fix [Bug #825095](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/825095)
        * Analysis:
          * Partial matching is used even when there are no NULLs in\
            a materialized subquery, as long as the left NOT IN operand\
            may contain NULL values.
          * This case was not handled correctly in two different places.\
            First, the implementation of parital matching did not clear\
            the set of matching columns when the merge process advanced\
            to the next row.
          * Second, there is no need to perform partial matching at all\
            when the left operand has no NULLs.
        * Solution:
          * First fix subselect\_rowid\_merge\_engine::partial\_match() to\
            properly cleanup the bitmap of matching keys when advancing\
            to the next row.
          * Second, change subselect\_partial\_match\_engine::exec() so\
            that when the materialized subquery doesn't contain any\
            NULLs, and the left operand of \[NOT] IN doesn't contain\
            NULLs either, the method returns without doing any\
            unnecessary partial matching. The correct result in this\
            case is in Item::in\_value.

    * The bug is a duplicate of MySQL's bug#11764086,\

      this fix is slightly different.
    * In addition, this patch renames\

      to make it in line with the analogous methods of\
      Item\_in\_optimizer, and Item\_subselect.

      * It is possible to determine whether a predicate is\
        NULL-rejecting only if it is a top-level one. However,\
        this was not taken into account for Item\_in\_optimizer.\
        As a result, a NOT IN predicate was erroneously\
        considered as NULL-rejecting, and the NULL-complemented\
        rows generated by the outer join were rejected before\
        being checked by the NOT IN predicate.
    * Solution:
      * Change Item\_in\_optimizer to be considered as\
        NULL-rejecting only if it a top-level predicate.

  * Fix [Bug #817384](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/817384)
    * This bug is a special case of [Bug #813447](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/813447).
    * Analysis:
      * Constant optimization finds that the condition t2.a = 1\
        can be used to access the primary key of table 't2'. As\
        a result both outer table t1,t2 are considered as constant\
        when we reach the execution phase. At the same time, during\
        constant optimization, the IN predicate is not evaluated\
        because it is expensive.
      *   When execution of the outer query reaches do\_select(),\
          control flow enter the branch:

          ```
          if (join->table_count == join->const_tables)
           { ... }
          ```
  * This branch checks only the WHERE and HAVING clauses,\
    but doesn't check the ON clauses of the query. Since the\
    IN predicate was not evaluated during optimization, it is\
    not evaluated at all, thus execution doesn't detect that\
    the ON clause is FALSE.\\
  * Solution:
  * Similar to the patch for [Bug #813447](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/813447), exclude system\
    tables from constant substitution based on unique key\
    lookups if there is an expensive ON condition on the\
    inner table.

message:
 BUG#11765831: 'RANGE ACCESS' MAY INCORRECTLY FILTER 
 AWAY QUALIFYING ROWS
.
 The problem was that the ranges created when OR'ing two 
 conditions could be incorrect. Without the bugfix, 
 "I <> 6 OR (I <> 8 AND J = 5)" would create these ranges:
.
 "NULL < I < 6",
 "6 <= I <= 6 AND 5 <= J <= 5",
 "6 < I < 8",
 "8 <= I <= 8 AND 5 <= J <= 5",
 "8 < I"
.
 While the correct ranges is
 "NULL < I < 6",
 "6 <= I <= 6 AND 5 <= J <= 5",
 "6 < I"
.
 The problem occurs when key_or() ORs
 (1) "NULL < I < 6, 6 <= I <= 6 AND 5 <= J <= 5, 6 < I" with 
 (2) "8 < I AND 5 <= J <= 5"
.
 The reason for the bug is that in key_or(), SEL_ARG *tmp is 
 used to point to the range in (1) above that is merged with 
 (2) while key1 points to the root of the red-black tree of 
 (1). When merging (1) and (2), tmp refers to the "6 < I" 
 part whereas the root is the "6 <= ... AND 5 <= J <= 5" part. 
.
 key_or() decides that the tmp range needs to be split into
 "6 < I < 8, 8 <= I <= 8, 8 < I", in which next_key_part of the 
 second range should be that of tmp. However, next_key_part is
 set to key1->next_key_part ("5 <= J <= 5") instead of 
 tmp->next_key_part (empty). Fixing this gives the correct but
 not optimal ranges:
 "NULL < I < 6",
 "6 <= I <= 6 AND 5 <= J <= 5",
 "6 < I < 8",
 "8 <= I <= 8",
 "8 < I"
.
 A second problem can be seen above: key_or() may create 
 adjacent ranges that could be replaced with a single range. 
 Fixes for this is also included in the patch so that the range
 above becomes correct AND optimal:
 "NULL < I < 6",
 "6 <= I <= 6 AND 5 <= J <= 5",
 "6 < I"
.
 Merging adjacent ranges like this gives a slightly lower cost 
 estimate for the range access.

  * Fixed [Bug #817360](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/817360).
    * This problem could be observed for queries with nested outer joins\
      for which the not\_exist optimization were applicable.\
      The problem was caused by the code of the patch for [MySQL Bug #49322](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49322)\
      that erroneously forced the return to the previous nested loop\
      level when the join algorithm successfully builds a partial record\
      for an embedded outer to which the not\_exist optimization could be\
      applied.
    * Actually the immediate return to the previous nested loops level\
      is correct only if this partial record is rejected by a predicate\
      pushed down to one of the inner tables of this outer join. Otherwise\
      attempts to find extensions of this record must be made.
* [Revision #3135](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3135)\
