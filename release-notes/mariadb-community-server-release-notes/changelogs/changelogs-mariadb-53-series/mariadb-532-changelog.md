    * [Bug #860580](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/860580): Sporadic crash / valgrind warning in register\_field\_in\_read\_map() with semijoin
    * The problem:
      * in an uncorrelated subquery, JOIN execution code may make\
        irreversible cleanups after it has been executed (because the subquery\
        won't be executed again). In particular, JTBM nests and their injected\
        IN-equalities will be invalidated (the materialized table will be dropped\
        and TABLE structure freed).
    * Solution:
      * don't walk into Item\_subselect if represents an uncorrelated\
        subselect that has already been executed. The idea is that the subselect\
        will not be executed again (calling Item\_subselect\_xxx::val\_int() will fetch\
        the cached value), so it should not matter what is inside the subselect.

  Tue 2011-10-04 23:57:46 +0300
  * Fix [Bug #856152](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/856152)
  * Analysis:
    * The cause of the bug was that the method\
      subselect\_rowid\_merge\_engine::partial\_match()\
      was not designed for re-execution within the\
      same query. Specifically, it didn't cleanup\
      the bitmap of matching keys after completion.
    * The test query requires double execution of\
      the IN predicate because it first checks the\
      predicate as a constant condition. The second\
      execution during regular execution used the bitmap\
      of matching keys produced by the first execution\
      instead of starting with a clean one.
  * Solution:
    * Cleanup the bitmap of matching keys at the end of\
      the partial matching procedure.

    Fri 2011-09-30 21:53:59 -0700
    * The previous correction of the cost estimate to access a joined table\
      in the function best\_access\_path revealed another bug: currently\
      table scans on NULL keys used for NOT IN subqueries cannot work\
      together with employment of join caches for inner tables of these\
      subqueries. Otherwise the result can be wrong as it could be seen\
      with the result of the test case constructed for bug #37894\
      in the file subselect3\_jcl6.result.
  * [Revision #3190.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3190.2.1)\

    * Fixed a cost estimation bug introduced into in the function best\_access\_path\
      of the 5.3 code line after a merge with 5.2 on 2010-10-28\
      in order not to allow the cost to access a joined table to be equal\
      to 0 ever.
    * Expanded data sets for many test cases to get the same execution plans\
      as before.

  Mon 2011-10-03 22:48:15 +0300
  * Fix [Bug #858038](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/858038)
  * Analysis:
    * The cause of the bug was the changed meaning of\
      subselect\_partial\_match\_engine::has\_covering\_null\_row.\
      Previously it meant that there is row with NULLs in\
      all nullable fields of the materialized subquery table.\
      Later it was changed to mean a row with NULLs in all\
      fields of this table.
    * At the same time there was a shortcut in\
      subselect\_rowid\_merge\_engine::partial\_match() that\
      detected a special case where:
      * there is no match in any of the columns with NULLs, and
      * there is no NULL-only row that covers all columns with\
        NULLs.
    * With the change in the meaning of has\_covering\_null\_row,\
      the condition that detected this special case was incomplete.
    * This resulted in an incorrect FALSE, when the result was a\
      partial match.
  * Solution:
    * Expand the condition that detected the special case with the\
      correct test for the existence of a row with NULL values in\
      all columns that contain NULLs (a kind of parially covering\
      NULL-row).

    * [Bug #860553](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/860553): Crash in create\_ref\_for\_key with semijoin + materialization
      * The problem was that JOIN::save/restore\_query\_plan() did not save/restore parts of\
        the query plan that are located inside SJ\_MATERIALIZATION\_INFO structures. This could\
        cause parts of one plan to be used with another, which led get\_best\_combination() to\
        constructing non-sensical join plans (and crash).\
        Fixed by saving/restoring SJM parts of the query plans.
      * check\_and\_do\_in\_subquery\_rewrites() will not set SUBS\_MATERIALIZATION flag when it\
        records that the subquery predicate is to be converted into semi-join.\
        If convert\_join\_subqueries\_to\_semijoins() later decides not to convert to semi-join,\
        let it set SUBS\_MATERIALIZATION flag, if appropriate.

  * Fix [Bug #858148](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/858148).
  * Analysis:
    * The crash is a result of the same cause as all similar\
      bugs ([Bug #827416](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/827416), [Bug #718763](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/718763), [Bug #778413](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/778413), [Bug #806943](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806943),[Bug #611690](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/611690)). The general pattern is that some optimization\
      requires the evaluation of some condition (e.g. the WHERE\
      clause), and this condition contains a subquery, such that\
      the subquery itself requires a temporary table for its\
      execution. During the subquery execution the original\
      tables in the FROM clause are replaced by the temporary\
      table needed for the final GROUP or ORDER operation. All\
      this happens during optimization of the outer query. Later\
      when EXPLAIN is run for the subquery, explain attempts to\
      print the name of the tables in the FROM clause, but it\
      finds there a temporary table without a corresponding\
      TABLE\_LIST object. The attempt to print the name of a\
      NULL table list results in a crash.
  * Solution:
    * This patch extends the fix to bug [Bug #702301](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/702301), and dissalows\
      constant substitution of aggregate functions if the filter\
      condition used to check MIN/MAX keys is an expensive condition.

      * If SOFT is used then the KILL will not be sent to the handler. This can be used to not interrupt critical things in the handler like 'REPAIR'.
    * Internally added more kill signals. This gives us more information of why a query/connection was killed.
      * KILL\_SERVER is used when server is going down. In this case the users gets ER\_SHUTDOWN as the reason connection was killed.
      * Changed signals to number in correct order, which makes it easier to test how the signal should affect the code.
      * New error message ER\_CONNECTION\_KILLED if connection was killed by 'KILL CONNECTION'. Before we got error ER\_SHUTDOWN.
