  Tue 2012-02-14 16:52:56 +0200
  * Fix for [Bug #910123](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/910123) [MariaDB 5.3.3](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/mariadb-533-release-notes.md) causes 1093 error on Drupal
  * Problem was that now we can merge derived table (subquery in the FROM clause).
  * Fix: in case of detected conflict and presence of derived table "over" the table which cased the conflict - try materialization strategy.

    Tue 2012-02-14 13:58:57 +0400
    * [Bug #928048](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/928048): Query containing IN subquery with OR in the where clause returns a wrong result
    * Make equality propagation work correctly when done inside the OR branches
* [Revision #3418](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3418)\
  Mon 2012-02-13 23:46:57 -0800
  * Fixed [Bug #925985](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/925985).
  * If the flag 'optimize\_join\_buffer\_size' is set to 'off' and the value\
    of the system variable 'join\_buffer\_size' is greater than the value of\
    the system variable 'join\_buffer\_space\_limit' than no join cache can\
    be employed to join tables of the executed query.
  * A bug in the function JOIN\_CACHE::alloc\_buffer allowed to use join\
    buffer even in this case while another bug in the function\
    revise\_cache\_usage could cause a crash of the server in this case if the\
    chosen execution plan for the query contained outer join or semi-join\
    operation.
* [Revision #3417](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3417)\
  Mon 2012-02-13 17:14:10 +0100
  * When we fail during slave thread initialisation, keep mi->run\_lock\
    locked until we have finished clean up.
  * Previously, the code released the lock without marking that the thread\
    was running. This allowed a new slave thread to start while the old one\
    was still in the middle of cleaning up, causing assertions and probably\
    general mayhem.

    * Fix for [MDEV-140](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-140), [Bug #930145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930145) - broken SSL connectivity for some connectors
    * [Revision #2643.150.3](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/2643.150.3)\
      Sat 2012-02-11 03:25:49 +0100
      * fixes bug(s): [Bug #930145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930145)
      * A recent change in the server protocol code broke SSL connection for some\
        client libraries.
      * Protocol documentation\
        ([MySQL\_Internals\_ClientServer\_Protocol](https://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol)) says\
        that initial packet sent by client if client wants SSL, consists of client\
        capability flags only (4 bytes or 2 bytes edependent on protocol\
        versionl).
      * Some clients happen to send more in the initial SSL packet (C client,\
        Python connector), while others (Java, .NET) follow the docs and send only\
        client capability flags.
      * A change that broke Java client was a newly introduced check that frst\
        client packet has 32 or more bytes. This is generally wrong, if client\
        capability flags contains CLIENT\_SSL.
      * Also, fixed the code such that read max client packet size and charset in\
        the first packet prior to SSL handshake. With SSL, clients do not have to\
        send this info, they can only send client flags.
      * This is now fixed such that max packet size and charset are not read prior\
        to SSL handshake, in case of SSL they are read from the "complete" client\
        authentication packet after SSL initialization.

      * [Bug #910817](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/910817): Race condition in kill\_threads\_for\_user()
      * The code was accessing a pointer in a mem\_root that might be freed by\
        another concurrent thread. Fix by moving the access to be done while the\
        LOCK\_thd\_data is held, preventing the memory from being freed too early.

        * Fix check of view updatability in case of underlying view changes its\
          updatability.
        * For single table update/insert added deep check of single tables\
          (single\_table\_updatable()). For multi-table view insert added additional\

  Fri 2012-02-03 00:46:34 -0800
  * Back-ported the fix for bug #12831587 from mysql-5.6 code line.
  * The comment for the fix commit says:
    * Due to the changes required by ICP we first copy a row from the InnoDB\
      format to the MySQL row buffer and then copy it to the pre-fetch queue.\
      This was done for the non-ICP code path too. This change removes the double\
      copy for the latter.
* [Revision #3406](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3406)\
  Thu 2012-02-02 22:22:27 -0800
  * Applied the patch from mysql-5.6 code line that fixed\
    a significant performance drop for high concurrency bechmarks (bug #11765850
* [MySQL Bug #58854](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=58854)).
* Here's the comment of the patch commit:
  * The bug is that the InnoDB pre-fetch cache was not being used in\
    row\_search\_for\_mysql(). Secondly the changeset that planted the bug also\
    introduced some inefficient code. It would read an extra row, convert it to\
    MySQL row format (for ICP==off), copy the row to the pre-fetch cache row\
    buffer, then check for cache overflow and dequeue the row that was pushed\
    if there was a possibility of a cache overflow.

        created for any TABLE\_REF may contain elements for constant items. These\
        items should be ignored by thefunction.

      * Back-ported the test case for bug #12616253 from mariadb-5.3 that\

      * Back-ported the test cases for bug #12763207 from mysql-5.6 code line into 5.2
      * Completed the fix for this bug.
      * Note: in 5.3 the affected 'if' statement in Item\_in\_subselect::single\_value\_transformer()\
        starting with the condition (thd->variables.sql\_mode & MODE\_ONLY\_FULL\_GROUP\_BY)\
        should be removed altogether. The change from table.cc is not needed either.
      * This is because in 5.3
        * min/max transformation for subqueries are done at the optimization phase
        * evaluation of the expensive subqueries is done at the execution phase.
      * Added an `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` to the test case for bug #12329653.

        bitmap. This could lead to wrong results for queries containing natural\
        join expressions or USING clauses.

      * Fixed [Bug #904345](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/904345).
      * The MIN/MAX optimizer code from the function opt\_sum\_query erroneously\
        did not take into account conjunctive conditions that did not depend on\
        any table, yet were not identified as constant items. These could be\
        items containing rand() or PS/SP parameters. These items are supposed\
        to be evaluated at the execution phase. That's why if such conditions\
        can be extracted from the WHERE condition the MIN/MAX optimization is\
        not applied as currently it is always done at the optimization phase.
      * (In 5.3 expensive subqueries are also evaluated only at the execution\
        phase. So, if a constant condition with such subquery can be extracted\
        from the WHERE clause the MIN/MAX optimization should not be applied\
        in 5.3.)
      * IF an IN/ALL/SOME predicate with a constant left part is transformed\
        into an EXISTS subquery the resulting subquery should not be considered\
        uncacheable if the right part of the predicate is not uncacheable.
      * Backported the function dbug\_print\_item() from 5.3. The function is used\
        only for debugging.

  * Back-ported the patch of the mysql-5.6 code line that\
    fixed several defects in the greedy optimization:
    1. The greedy optimizer calculated the 'compare-cost' (CPU-cost)\
       for iterating over the partial plan result at each level in\
       the query plan as 'record\_count / (double) TIME\_FOR\_COMPARE'

This cost was only used locally for 'best' calculation at each\
level, and _not_ accumulated into the total cost for the query plan.

This fix added the 'CPU-cost' of processing 'current\_record\_count'\
records at each level to 'current\_read\_time' _before_ it is used as\
'accumulated cost' argument to recursive\
best\_extension\_by\_limited\_search() calls. This ensured that the\
cost of a huge join-fanout early in the QEP was correctly\
reflected in the cost of the final QEP.

To get identical cost for a 'best' optimized query and a\
straight\_join with the same join order, the same change was also\
applied to optimize\_straight\_join() and get\_partial\_join\_cost()\
1\. Furthermore to get equal cost for 'best' optimized query and a\
straight\_join the new code substrcated the same '0.001' in\
optimize\_straight\_join() as it had been already done in\
best\_extension\_by\_limited\_search()\
1\. When best\_extension\_by\_limited\_search() aggregated the 'best' plan a\
plan was 'best' by the check :

'if ((search\_depth == 1) || (current\_read\_time < join->best\_read))'

The term '(search\_depth == 1' incorrectly caused a new best plan to be\
collected whenever the specified 'search\_depth' was reached - even if\
this partial query plan was more expensive than what we had already\
found.
