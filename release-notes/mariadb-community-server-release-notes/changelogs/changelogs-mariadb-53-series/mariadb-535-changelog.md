* [Revision #3450](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3450)\
  Tue 2012-02-28 15:41:55 +0100
  * [Bug #938977](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/938977) - Query performance with join/index super slow on [MariaDB 5.3.4](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/mariadb-534-release-notes.md)RC
  * make sure that stored routines are evaluated (that is, de facto - cached) in convert\_const\_to\_int().\
    revert the fix for [Bug #806943](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806943) because it cannot be repeated anymore.\
    add few tests for convert\_const\_to\_int()

      * Fixed [Bug #905716](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/905716) "Assertion \`page->size <= share->max\_index\_block\_size'"
      * The issue was that Aria allowed too long keys to be created (so that the internal buffer was not big enough to hold the whole key).
      * Key lengths is now limited to HA\_MAX\_KEY\_LENGTH (1000), as for MyISAM.
      * Fixed failure in "\_ma\_apply\_redo\_index: Assertion \`new\_page\_length == 0", as found by buildbot.

  * [Revision #3439.2.1](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3439.2.1)\
    Fri 2012-02-24 16:50:22 -0800
    * Fixed [Bug #939009](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/939009).
    * The result of materialization of the right part of an IN subquery predicate\
      is placed into a temporary table. Each row of the materialized table is\
      distinct. A unique key over all fields of the temporary table is defined and\
      created. It allows to perform key look-ups into the table.\
      The table created for a materialized subquery can be accessed by key as\
      any other table. The function best\_access-path search for the best access\
      to join a table to a given partial join. With some where conditions this\
      function considers a possibility of a ref\_or\_null access. If such access\
      employs the unique key on the temporary table then when estimating\
      the cost this access the function tries to use the array rec\_per\_key. Yet,\
      such array is not built for this unique key. This causes a crash of the server.
    * Rows returned by the subquery that contain nulls don't have to be placed\
      into temporary table, as they cannot be match any row produced by the\
      left part of the subquery predicate. So all fields of the temporary table\
      can be defined as non-nullable. In this case any ref\_or\_null access\
      to the temporary table does not make any sense and it does not make sense\
      to estimate such an access.
    * The fix makes sure that the temporary table for a materialized IN subquery\
      is defined with columns that are all non-nullable. The also ensures that\
      any row with nulls returned by the subquery is not placed into the\
      temporary table.

  * Fixed [Bug #934348](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/934348).
  * This bug is the result of an incomplete/inconsistent change introduced into\
    5.3 code when the cond\_equal parameter were added to the function optimize\_cond.
  * The change was made during a merge from 5.2 in October 2010.
  * The bug could affect only queries with HAVING.

  * Fixed [Bug #934342](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/934342).
  * An outer join query with a semi-join subquery could return a wrong result\
    if the optimizer chose to materialize the subquery.
  * It happened because when substituting for the best field into a ref item\
    used to build access keys not all `COND_EQUAL` objects that could be employed\
    at substitution were checked.
  * Also refined some code in the function check\_join\_cache\_usage to make it\
    safer.

  * Remove engine-specific (but identical) icp callbacks. create one reusable\
    common icp callback in the handler.cc.
  * It can also increment status counters, without making the engine\
    dependent on the exact THD layout (that is different in embedded).

  * Fixed [Bug #928352](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/928352).
  * This bug led to wrong values of the use\_count fields in some SEL\_ARG\
    trees that triggered complains on the server side when executing the\
    test case for LP bug 800184 if a debug build of the server was used.
  * This was the result of the incomplete fix for [Bug #800184](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/800184).
  * To complete it the following corrections had to be made:
    * the copy constructor for SEL\_TREE must call the new function incr\_refs\_all()\
      instead of the function incr\_refs(), because references to next key parts\
      from any SEL\_ARG tree belonging to the list of the first key part has to be\
      adjusted.
    * the method and\_sel\_tree of the class SEL\_IMERGE must use the copy constructor\
      of the SEL\_TREE class to make a copy of its second argument before it ANDs it\
      with any SEL\_TREE tree from the processed SEL\_IMERGE object.

Fix for Bug#13430436 PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION IN SYSBENCH ON INNODB DUE TO ICP
.
When running sysbench on InnoDB there is a performance degradation due
to index condition pushdown (ICP). Several of the queries in sysbench
have a WHERE condition that the optimizer uses for executing these
queries as range scans. The upper and lower limit of the range scan
will ensure that the WHERE condition is fulfilled. Still, the WHERE
condition is part of the queries' condition and if ICP is enabled the
condition will be pushed down to InnoDB as an index condition. 
.
Due to the range scan's upper and lower limits ensure that the WHERE
condition is fulfilled, the pushed index condition will not filter out
any records. As a result the use of ICP for these queries results in a
performance overhead for sysbench. This overhead comes from using
resources for determining the part of the condition that can be pushed
down to InnoDB and overhead in InnoDB for executing the pushed index
condition.
.
With the default configuration for sysbench the range scans will use
the primary key. This is a clustered index in InnoDB. Using ICP on a
clustered index provides the lowest performance benefit since the
entire record is part of the clustered index and in InnoDB it has the
highest relative overhead for executing the pushed index condition.
.
The fix for removing the overhead ICP introduces when running sysbench
is to disable use of ICP when the index used by the query is a
clustered index.
.
When WL#6061 is implemented this change should be re-evaluated.
