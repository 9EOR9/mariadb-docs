  Mon 2012-08-13 21:13:14 -0700
  * Fixed bug [MDEV-449](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-449).
  * The bug could caused a crash when the server executed a query with\
    ORDER by and sort\_buffer\_size was set to a small enough number.
  * It happened because the small sort buffer did not allow to allocate\
    all merge buffers in it.
  * Made sure that the allocated sort buffer would be big enough\
    to contain all possible merge buffers.

  * [MDEV-398](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-398): Sergv related to spacial queries
  * index\_merge/intersection is unable to work on GIS indexes, because:
    1. index scans have no Rowid-Ordered-Retrieval property
    2. When one does an index-only read over a GIS index, they do not\
       get the index tuple, because index only contains bounding box of the geometry.\
       This is why key\_copy() call crashed.
  * This patch fixes #1, which makes the problem go away. Theoretically, it would\
    be nice to check #2, too, but SE API semantics is not sufficiently precise to do it.

    * Fixed bug [MDEV-354](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-354).
    * Virtual columns of ENUM and SET data types were not supported properly\
      in the original patch that introduced virtual columns into [MariaDB 5.2](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md).
    * The problem was that for any virtual column the patch used the\
      interval\_id field of the definition of the column in the frm file as\
      a reference to the virtual column expression.
    * The fix stores the optional interval\_id of the virtual column in the\
      extended header of the virtual column expression.

      * Fixed [Bug #1008293](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1008293).
        * One of the reported problems manifested itself in the scenario when one\
          thread tried to to get statistics on a key cache while the second thread\
          had not finished initialization of the key cache structure yet.\
          The problem was resolved by forcing serialization of such operations\
          on key caches.
        *
        * To serialize function calls to perform certain operations over a key cache\
          a new mutex associated with the key cache now is used. It is stored in the\
          field op\_lock of the KEY\_CACHE structure. It is locked when the operation\
          is performed. Some of the serialized key cache operations utilize calls\
          for other key cache operations. To avoid recursive locking of op\_lock\
          the new functions that perform the operations of key cache initialization,\
          destruction and re-partitioning with an additional parameter were introduced.
        *
        * The parameter says whether the operation over op\_lock are to be performed or\
          are to be omitted. The old functions for the operations of key cache\
          initialization, destruction,and re-partitioning now just call the\
          corresponding new functions with the additional parameter set to true\
          requesting to use op\_lock while all other calls of these new function\
          have this parameter set to false.
        *
        * Another problem reported in the bug entry concerned the operation of\
          assigning an index to a key cache. This operation can be called\
          while the key cache structures are not initialized yet. In this\
          case any call of flush\_key\_blocks() should return without any actions.
        *
        * No test case is provided with this patch.

    * Fix [Bug #1001506](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1001506)
    * This is a backport of the (unchaged) fix for MySQL bug #11764372, 57197.
    * Analysis:
      * When the outer query finishes its main execution and computes GROUP BY,\
        it needs to construct a new temporary table (and a corresponding JOIN) to\
        execute the last DISTINCT operation. At this point JOIN::exec calls\
        JOIN::join\_free, which calls JOIN::cleanup -> TMP\_TABLE\_PARAM::cleanup\
        for both the outer and the inner JOINs. The call to the inner\
        TMP\_TABLE\_PARAM::cleanup sets copy\_field = NULL, but not copy\_field\_end.
      *
      * The final execution phase that computes the DISTINCT invokes:\
        evaluate\_join\_record -> end\_write -> copy\_funcs\
        The last function copies the results of all functions into the temp table.\
        copy\_funcs walks over all functions in join->tmp\_table\_param.items\_to\_copy.\
        In this case items\_to\_copy contains both assignments to user variables.\
        The process of copying user variables invokes Item\_func\_set\_user\_var::check\
        which in turn re-evaluates the arguments of the user variable assignment.\
        This in turn triggers re-evaluation of the subquery, and ultimately\
        copy\_field.
      *
      * However, the previous call to TMP\_TABLE\_PARAM::cleanup for the subquery\
        already set copy\_field to NULL but not its copy\_field\_end. This results\
        in a null pointer access, and a crash.
      *
    * Fix:
      * Set copy\_field\_end and save\_copy\_field\_end to null when deleting\
        copy fields in TMP\_TABLE\_PARAM::cleanup().

  * Fix [Bug #1008686](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1008686)
  * Analysis:
    * The fix for bug [Bug #985667](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/985667) implements the method Item\_subselect::no\_rows\_in\_result()\
      for all main kinds of subqueries. The purpose of this method is to be called from\
      return\_zero\_rows() and set Items to some default value in the case when a query\
      returns no rows. Aggregates and subqueries require special treatment in this case.
    *
    * Every implementation of Item\_subselect::no\_rows\_in\_result() called\
      Item\_subselect::make\_const() to set the subquery predicate to its default value\
      irrespective of where the predicate was located in the query. Once the predicate\
      was set to a constant it was never executed.
    *
    * At the same time, the JOIN object of the fake select for UNIONs (the one used for\
      the final result of the UNION), was set after all subqueries in the union were\
      executed. Since we set the subquery as constant, it was never executed, and the\
      corresponding JOIN was never created.
    *
    * In order to decide whether the result of NOT IN is NULL or FALSE, Item\_in\_optimizer\
      needs to check if the subquery result was empty or not. This is where we got the\
      crash, because subselect\_union\_engine::no\_rows() checks for\
      unit->fake\_select\_lex->join->send\_records, and the join object was NULL.
    *
  * Solution:
    * If a subquery is in the HAVING clause it must be evaluated in order to know its\
      result, so that we can properly filter the result records. Once subqueries in the\
      HAVING clause are executed even in the case of no result rows, this specific\
      crash will be solved, because the UNION will be executed, and its JOIN will be\
      constructed. Therefore the fix for this crash is to narrow the fix for [Bug #985667](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/985667),\
      and to apply Item\_subselect::no\_rows\_in\_result() only when the subquery predicate\
      is in the SELECT clause.

  * Fix [Bug #1008773](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1008773)
  * Analysis:
    * Queries with implicit grouping (there is aggregate, but no group by)\
      follow some non-obvious semantics in the case of empty result set.\
      Aggregate functions produce some special "natural" value depending on\
      the function. For instance MIN/MAX return NULL, COUNT returns 0.
    *
    * The complexity comes from non-aggregate expressions in the select list.\
      If the non-aggregate expression is a constant, it can be computed, so\
      we should return its value, however if the expression is non-constant,\
      and depends on columns from the empty result set, then the only meaningful\
      value is NULL.
    *
    * The cause of the wrong result was that for subqueries the optimizer didn't\
      make a difference between constant and non-constant ones in the case of\
      empty result for implicit grouping.
  * Solution:
    * In all implementations of Item\_subselect::no\_rows\_in\_result() check if the\
      subquery predicate is constant. If it is constant, do not set it to the\
      default value for implicit grouping, instead let it be evaluated.

  * Analysis:
    * When a subquery that needs a temp table is executed during\
      the prepare or optimize phase of the outer query, at the end\
      of the subquery execution all the JOIN\_TABs of the subquery\
      are replaced by a new JOIN\_TAB that selects from the temp table.\
      However that temp table has no corresponding TABLE\_LIST.\
      Once EXPLAIN execution reaches its last phase, it tries to print\
      the names of the subquery tables through its TABLE\_LISTs, but in\
      the case of this bug there is no such TABLE\_LIST (it is NULL),\
      hence a crash.

      Original comment:

      3714 Jorgen Loland	2012-03-01
       BUG#12640437 - USING SQL_BUFFER_RESULT RESULTS IN A DIFFERENT 
       QUERY OUTPUT
       .
       For all but simple grouped queries, temporary tables are used to
       resolve grouping. In these cases, the list of grouping fields is
       stored in the temporary table and grouping is resolved
       there (e.g. by adding a unique constraint on the involved
       fields). Because of this, grouping is already done when the rows
       are read from the temporary table.
       .
       In the case where a group clause may be optimized away, grouping
       does not have to be resolved using a temporary table. However, if
       a temporary table is explicitly requested (e.g. because the
       SQL_BUFFER_RESULT hint is used, or the statement is
       INSERT...SELECT), a temporary table is used anyway. In this case,
       the temporary table is created with an empty group list (because
       the group clause was optimized away) and it will therefore not
       create groups. Since the temporary table does not take care of
       grouping, JOIN::group shall not be set to false in 
       make_simple_join(). This was fixed in bug 12578908. 
       .
       However, there is an exception where make_simple_join() should
       set JOIN::group to false even if the query uses a temporary table
       that was explicitly requested but is not strictly needed. That
       exception is if the loose index scan access method (explain
       says "Using index for group-by") is used to read into the 
       temporary table. With loose index scan, grouping is resolved 
       by the access method. This is exactly what happens in this bug.

  * Fix [Bug #993745](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/993745)
  * This is a backport of the fix for MySQL bug #13723054 in 5.6.
  *   Original comment:

      ```
      The crash is caused by arbitrary memory area owerwriting in case of
      BLOB fields during attempt to copy BLOB field key image into record
      buffer(record buffer is too small to get BLOB key part image).
      note:
      QUICK_GROUP_MIN_MAX_SELECT can not work with BLOB fields
      because it uses record buffer as temporary buffer for key values
      however this case is filtered out by covering_keys() check
      in get_best_group_min_max() as BLOBs always require key length
      modificator in the key declaration and if the key has a BLOB
      then it can not be covered key.
      The fix is to use 'max_used_key_length' key length instead of 0.
      ```
* Analysis:
  * Spcifically the crash in this bug was a result of the call to key\_copy()\
    that copied the whole key, inlcuding the BLOB field which is not used\
    for index access. Copying the blob field overwrote memory as far as the\
    function parameter 'key\_info'. As a result the contents of key\_info was\
    all 0, which resulted in a crash when this key\_info was accessed few\
    lines below in key\_cmp().

  * Addition to the fix to [Bug #994275](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/994275).
  * It is problem of constant propagated to ref\* access method (the problem was hiden by using debug binaries for testing).
* [Revision #3517](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.3/revision/3517)\
  Mon 2012-05-07 21:14:37 +0300
  * [Bug #994275](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/994275) fix.
  * In 5.3 we substitute constants in ref access values it can't be null so we do not need add NOT NULL for early NULL filtering.
