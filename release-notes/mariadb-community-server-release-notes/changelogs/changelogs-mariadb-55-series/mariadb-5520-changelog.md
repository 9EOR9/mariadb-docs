    * This bug is the result of an incomplete/inconsistent change introduced into\
      5.3 code when the cond\_equal parameter were added to the function optimize\_cond.

    * Fixed [Bug #934342](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/934342).
    * An outer join query with a semi-join subquery could return a wrong result\
      if the optimizer chose to materialize the subquery.
    * It happened because when substituting for the best field into a ref item\
      used to build access keys not all COND\_EQUAL objects that could be employed\
      at substitution were checked.
    * Also refined some code in the function check\_join\_cache\_usage to make it\
      safer.

    * Fixed LP bug #928352.
    * This bug led to wrong values of the use\_count fields in some SEL\_ARG\
      trees that triggered complains on the server side when executing the\
      test case for LP bug 800184 if a debug build of the server was used.
    * This was the result of the incomplete fix for bug 800184.
    * To complete it the following corrections had to be made:
      * the copy constructor for SEL\_TREE must call the new function incr\_refs\_all()\
        instead of the function incr\_refs(), because references to next key parts\
        from any SEL\_ARG tree belonging to the list of the first key part has to be\
        adjusted.
      * the method and\_sel\_tree of the class SEL\_IMERGE must use the copy constructor\
        of the SEL\_TREE class to make a copy of its second argument before it ANDs it\
        with any SEL\_TREE tree from the processed SEL\_IMERGE object.

      * Fix for Bug#13430436 PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION IN SYSBENCH ON INNODB DUE TO ICP
      * When running sysbench on InnoDB there is a performance degradation due\
        to index condition pushdown (ICP). Several of the queries in sysbench\
        have a WHERE condition that the optimizer uses for executing these\
        queries as range scans. The upper and lower limit of the range scan\
        will ensure that the WHERE condition is fulfilled. Still, the WHERE\
        condition is part of the queries' condition and if ICP is enabled the\
        condition will be pushed down to InnoDB as an index condition.
      * Due to the range scan's upper and lower limits ensure that the WHERE\
        condition is fulfilled, the pushed index condition will not filter out\
        any records. As a result the use of ICP for these queries results in a\
        performance overhead for sysbench. This overhead comes from using\
        resources for determining the part of the condition that can be pushed\
        down to InnoDB and overhead in InnoDB for executing the pushed index\
        condition.
      * With the default configuration for sysbench the range scans will use\
        the primary key. This is a clustered index in InnoDB. Using ICP on a\
        clustered index provides the lowest performance benefit since the\
        entire record is part of the clustered index and in InnoDB it has the\
        highest relative overhead for executing the pushed index condition.
      * The fix for removing the overhead ICP introduces when running sysbench\
        is to disable use of ICP when the index used by the query is a\
        clustered index.
      * When [WL#6061](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=6061) is implemented this change should be re-evaluated.

  * Fix wrong error code in the test case.
  * The replication slave sets first error 1913 and immediately after error

1595. Thus it is possible, but unlikely, to get 1913. The original test\
      seems to realise this, but uses an invalid error code - my guess is\
      that this was a temporary code used in a feature tree, which was then\
      forgotten to be fixed when merged to main. The removed "1923" is\
      something committed by mistake during tests.

      the intended receipient has no time to see the signal before it is cleared\
      by the RESET, causing wait to timeout.

    * [MDEV-100](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-100) : innodb\_plugin tests fail on Solaris.
    * The reason for the failure is that the loaded library has the same exported symbols\
      as the builtin one. So the plugin uses innodb functions e.g srv\_boot from mysqld\
      rather than plugin's own. This causes the crash.
    * On Unix systems with gcc4 later this error was so far worked around using GCC's\
      visibility attribute. However, in our case, we're using gcc3.
    * See related MySQL bug [bug.php?id=48524](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48524) and[bug.php?id=52263](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52263)
    * The fix is to restrict symbol visibility in the plugin using version script\
      (called map file on Solaris).

    overrides the settings in my.cnf. Avoid this by having mariadb.cnf mostly\
    empty for now, and in the future we can add just new mariadb-specific\

      reasons for output to be different on Unix (some different threads, some\
      different locks), the differences are expected to grow in the future, e.g\

  * Contributed by Maarten Vanraes (AL13N)
  * Fix things so that chains of certificates work in the server and client\
    certificate files.
  * This only really works for OpenSSL-based builds, as yassl is unable to read\
    multiple certificates from a file. The patch below to yassl/src/ssl.cpp\
    doesn't fix that, but just arranges that the viosslfactories.c patch won't\
    have any ill effects in a yassl build.
