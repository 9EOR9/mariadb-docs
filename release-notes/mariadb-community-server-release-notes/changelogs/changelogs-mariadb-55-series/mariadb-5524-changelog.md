      * [MDEV-262](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-262) : log\_state occationally fails in buildbot.
      * The failures are missing entries in the slow query log. The reason for the failure are sleep() calls with short duration 10ms, which is less than the default system timer resolution for various WaitForXXXObject functions (15.6 ms) and thus can't work reliably.
      * The fix is to make sleeps tiny bit longer (20ms from 10ms) in the test.

        let x = `SELECT <something>`
      * The fix is to detect the condition "no active connection", to report error and die.
      * Note, that the check for no active connection was already in place for ordinary commands,\
        and was missing only for assign-variable command.

        * BUG#12640437: USING SQL\_BUFFER\_RESULT RESULTS IN A DIFFERENT QUERY OUTPUT
        * Bug#12578908: SELECT SQL\_BUFFER\_RESULT OUTPUTS TOO MANY ROWS WHEN GROUP IS OPTIMIZED AWAY
        * Original comment:
          * 3714 Jorgen Loland 2012-03-01
          * BUG#12640437 - USING SQL\_BUFFER\_RESULT RESULTS IN A DIFFERENT\
            QUERY OUTPUT
          * For all but simple grouped queries, temporary tables are used to\
            resolve grouping. In these cases, the list of grouping fields is\
            stored in the temporary table and grouping is resolved\
            there (e.g. by adding a unique constraint on the involved\
            fields). Because of this, grouping is already done when the rows\
            are read from the temporary table.
          *
          * In the case where a group clause may be optimized away, grouping\
            does not have to be resolved using a temporary table. However, if\
            a temporary table is explicitly requested (e.g. because the\
            SQL\_BUFFER\_RESULT hint is used, or the statement is\
            INSERT...SELECT), a temporary table is used anyway. In this case,\
            the temporary table is created with an empty group list (because\
            the group clause was optimized away) and it will therefore not\
            create groups. Since the temporary table does not take care of\
            grouping, JOIN::group shall not be set to false in\
            make\_simple\_join(). This was fixed in bug 12578908.
          *
          * However, there is an exception where make\_simple\_join() should\
            set JOIN::group to false even if the query uses a temporary table\
            that was explicitly requested but is not strictly needed. That\
            exception is if the loose index scan access method (explain\
            says "Using index for group-by") is used to read into the\
            temporary table. With loose index scan, grouping is resolved\
            by the access method. This is exactly what happens in this bug.
    * [Revision #2502.528.38](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maria-captains/maria/5.5/revision/2502.528.38)\
      Thu 2012-05-03 14:49:52 +0300
      * Fix [Bug #993745](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/993745)
      * This is a backport of the fix for MySQL bug #13723054 in 5.6.
      * Original comment:
        * The crash is caused by arbitrary memory area owerwriting in case of\
          BLOB fields during attempt to copy BLOB field key image into record\
          buffer(record buffer is too small to get BLOB key part image).\
          note:
        *
        * QUICK\_GROUP\_MIN\_MAX\_SELECT can not work with BLOB fields\
          because it uses record buffer as temporary buffer for key values\
          however this case is filtered out by covering\_keys() check\
          in get\_best\_group\_min\_max() as BLOBs always require key length\
          modificator in the key declaration and if the key has a BLOB\
          then it can not be covered key.\
          The fix is to use 'max\_used\_key\_length' key length instead of 0.
        *
        * Analysis:
        * Spcifically the crash in this bug was a result of the call to key\_copy()\
          that copied the whole key, inlcuding the BLOB field which is not used\
          for index access. Copying the blob field overwrote memory as far as the\
          function parameter 'key\_info'. As a result the contents of key\_info was\
          all 0, which resulted in a crash when this key\_info was accessed few\
          lines below in key\_cmp().

  * The optimizer chose a less efficient execution plan due to the following\
    defects of the code:
    1. the generic handler function handler::keyread\_time did not take into account\
       that in clustered primary keys record data is included into each index entry
    2. the function make\_join\_readinfo erroneously decided that index only scan\
       could not be used if join cache was empoyed.
  * Added no additional test case.

      * Fix [Bug #985667](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/985667), [MDEV-229](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-229)
      * Analysis:
        * The reason for the wrong result is the interaction between constant\
          optimization (in this case 1-row table) and subquery optimization.
        * First the outer query is optimized, and 'make\_join\_statistics' finds that\
          table t2 has one row, reads that row, and marks the whole table as constant.\
          This also means that all fields of t2 are constant.
        *
        * Next, we optimize the subquery in the end of the outer 'make\_join\_statistics'.\
          The field 'f2' is considered constant, with value '3'. The subquery predicate\
          is rewritten as the constant TRUE.
        *
        * The outer query execution detects early that the whole query result is empty\
          and calls 'return\_zero\_rows'. Since the query is with implicit grouping, we\
          have to produce one row with special values for the aggregates (depending on\
          each aggregate function), and NULL values for all non-aggregate fields. This\
          function calls 'no\_rows\_in\_result' to set each aggregate function to the\
          default value when it aggregates over an empty result, and then calls\
          'send\_data', which in turn evaluates each Item in the SELECT list.
        *
        * When evaluation reaches the subquery predicate, it executes the subquery\
          with field 'f2' having a constant value '3', and the subquery produces the\
          incorrect result '7'.
      * Solution:
        * Implement Item::no\_rows\_in\_result for all subquery predicates. In order to\
          make this work, it is also needed to make all val\_\* methods of all subquery\
          predicates respect the Item\_subselect::forced\_const flag. Otherwise subqueries\
          are executed anyways, and override the default value set by no\_rows\_in\_result\
          with whatever result is produced from the subquery evaluation.

        * As part of derived tables redesign, values for VIEW\_ALGORITHM\_MERGE and VIEW\_ALGORITHM\_TMPTABLE have changed from (former values 1 rsp 2 , new values 5 rsp 9).
        * This lead to the problem that views, created with version 5.2 or earlier would not work in all situations (e.g "SHOW CREATE VIEW"), or with mysqldump.
        * The fix is to restore backward compatibility for the from file, and convert algorithm={1,2} in the frm to {5,9} when reading .frm from disk, and store backward compatible values when writing from to disk.
        * Also allow processing correct processing for "invalid" .frms created with [MariaDB 5.3](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md)/5.5 GA releases (where algorithm stored in memory matched the one stored in frm).

        * [MDEV-221](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-221) - Properly escape command line when starting mysql\_install\_db\
          since password characters can contain quotes or spaces.
        * The proper quoting method for command line arguments used here was extracted from[everyone-quotes-arguments-the-wrong-way.aspx](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/twistylittlepassagesallalike/archive/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-arguments-the-wrong-way.aspx)
        * Additionally, mysql\_install\_db.exe now passes root password to `"mysqld.exe --bootstrap"`\
          in hexadecimal form, to handle potential special chars inside password string literal.

    * The previous patch for the bug (that erroneously identified the bug as [Bug #972973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/972973) in its comment) was incorrect.
    * It turned out that the code that triggered the abort complain reported for\
      the bug was not needed at all.
