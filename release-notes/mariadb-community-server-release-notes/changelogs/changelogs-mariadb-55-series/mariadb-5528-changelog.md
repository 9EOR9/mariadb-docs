    * Fix for [Bug #12667154](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/12667154) SAME QUERY EXEC AS WHERE SUBQ GIVES DIFFERENT\
      RESULTS ON IN() & NOT IN() COMP #3
    * This bug causes a wrong result in mysql-trunk when ICP is used\
      and bad performance in mysql-5.5 and mysql-trunk.
    * Using the query from bug report to explain what happens and causes\
      the wrong result from the query when ICP is enabled:
      1. The t3 table contains four records. The outer query will read\
         these and for each of these it will execute the subquery.
      2. Before the first execution of the subquery it will be optimized. In\
         this case the important is what happens to the first table t1:
      3. make\_join\_select() will call the range optimizer which decides\
         that t1 should be accessed using a range scan on the k1 index\
         It creates a QUICK\_RANGE\_SELECT object for this.
      4. As the last part of optimization the ICP code pushes the\
         condition down to the storage engine for table t1 on the k1 index.
      5. This produces the following information in the explain for this table:
         * 2 DEPENDENT SUBQUERY t1 range k1 k1 5 NULL 3 Using index condition; Using filesort
      6. Note the use of filesort.
      7. The first execution of the subquery does (among other things) due\
         to the need for sorting:
      8. Call create\_sort\_index() which again will call find\_all\_keys():
      9. find\_all\_keys() will read the required keys for all qualifying\
         rows from the storage engine. To do this it checks if it has a\
         quick-select for the table. It will use the quick-select for\
         reading records. In this case it will read four records from the\
         storage engine (based on the range criteria). The storage engine\
         will evaluate the pushed index condition for each record.
      10. At the end of create\_sort\_index() there is code that cleans up a\
          lot of stuff on the join tab. One of the things that is cleaned\
          is the select object. The result of this is that the\
          quick-select object created in make\_join\_select is deleted.
      11. The second execution of the subquery does the same as the first but\
          the result is different:
      12. Call create\_sort\_index() which again will call find\_all\_keys()\
          (same as for the first execution)
      13. find\_all\_keys() will read the keys from the storage engine. To\
          do this it checks if it has a quick-select for the table. Now\
          there is NO quick-select object(!) (since it was deleted in\
          step 3c). So find\_all\_keys defaults to read the table using a\
          table scan instead. So instead of reading the four relevant records\
          in the range it reads the entire table (6 records). It then\
          evaluates the table's condition (and here it goes wrong). Since\
          the entire condition has been pushed down to the storage engine\
          using ICP all 6 records qualify. (Note that the storage engine\
          will not evaluate the pushed index condition in this case since\
          it was pushed for the k1 index and now we do a table scan\
          without any index being used).\
          The result is that here we return six qualifying key values\
          instead of four due to not evaluating the table's condition.
      14. As above.
      15. The two last execution of the subquery will also produce wrong results\
          for the same reason.
      16. Summary: The problem occurs due to all but the first executions of the\
          subquery is done as a table scan without evaluating the table's\
          condition (which is pushed to the storage engine on a different\
          index). This is caused by the create\_sort\_index() function deleting\
          the quick-select object that should have been used for executing the\
          subquery as a range scan.
      17. Note that this bug in addition to causing wrong results also can\
          result in bad performance due to executing the subquery using a table\
          scan instead of a range scan. This is an issue in MySQL 5.5.
      18. The fix for this problem is to avoid that the Quick-select-object that\
          the optimizer created is deleted when create\_sort\_index() is doing\
          clean-up of the join-tab. This will ensure that the quick-select\
          object and the corresponding pushed index condition will be available\
          and used by all following executions of the subquery.

    * Fixed LP bug #1058071 ([MDEV-564](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-564)).
    * In some rare cases when the value of the system variable join\_buffer\_size\
      was set to a number less than 256 the function JOIN\_CACHE::set\_constants\
      determined the size of an offset in the join buffer equal to 1 though\
      the minimal join buffer required more than 256 bytes. This could cause\
      a crash of the server when records from the join buffer were read.

  * [MDEV-435](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-435): Expensive subqueries may be evaluated during optimization in merge\_key\_fields
  * Fix by Sergey Petrunia.
  * This patch only prevents the evaluation of expensive subqueries during optimization.
  * The crash reported in this bug has been fixed by some other patch.
  * The fix is to call value->is\_null() only when !value->is\_expensive(), because is\_null()\
    may trigger evaluation of the Item, which in turn triggers subquery evaluation if the\
    Item is a subquery.

  * [MDEV-3802](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-3802). Millisecond timeout support in non-blocking client library.
  * In 10.0, VIO timeouts can be in milliseconds, so we add a new function\
    mysql\_get\_timeout\_value\_ms() which can return millisecond-precision\
    timeout values.
  * In 5.5, we do not have millisecond precision for timeouts. But we still\
    provide the mysql\_get\_timeout\_value\_ms() function; this makes it easier\
    for applications as they can use the millisecond function in 10.0 and\
    still work with the 5.5 version of the client library.

  * This fix+comments was originally made by Alexey Kopytov
  * [Bug #1035225](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1035225) / MySQL bug #66301: INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE +\
    innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode=1 is broken
  * The problem was that when certain INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE\
    were executed concurrently on a table containing an AUTO\_INCREMENT\
    column as a primary key, InnoDB would correctly reserve non-overlapping\
    AUTO\_INCREMENT intervals for each statement, but when the server\
    encountered the first duplicate key error on the secondary key in one of\
    the statements and performed an UPDATE, it also updated the internal\
    AUTO\_INCREMENT value to the one from the existing row that caused a\
    duplicate key error, even though the AUTO\_INCREMENT value was not\
    specified explicitly in the UPDATE clause. It would then proceed with\
    using AUTO\_INCREMENT values the range reserved previously by another\
    statement, causing duplicate key errors on the AUTO\_INCREMENT column.
  * Fixed by changing write\_record() to ensure that in case of a duplicate\
    key error the internal AUTO\_INCREMENT counter is only updated when the\
    AUTO\_INCREMENT value was explicitly updated by the UPDATE\
    clause. Otherwise it is restored to what it was before the duplicate key\
    error, as that value is unused and can be reused for subsequent\
    successfully inserted rows.

    * Fix for [MDEV-533](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-533): Confusing error code when doing auto-increment insert for out-of-range values
      * create table t1 (a smallint primary key auto\_increment);
        * insert into t1 values(32767);
        * insert into t1 values(NULL);
        * ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '32767' for key 'PRIMARY
      * Now on always gets error HA\_ERR\_AUTOINC\_RANGE=167 "Out of range value for column", independent of\
        store engine, SQL Mode or number of inserted rows. This is an unique error that is easier to test for in replication.
      * Another bug fix is that we now get an error when trying to insert a too big auto-generated value, even in non-strict mode.
        * Before one get insted the max column value inserted.
        * This patch also fixes some issues with inserting negative numbers in an auto-increment column.
        * Fixed the ER\_DUP\_ENTRY and HA\_ERR\_AUTOINC\_ERANGE are compared the same between master and slave.
        * This ensures that replication works between an old server to a new slave for auto-increment overflow errors.
        * Added SQLSTATE errors for handler errors
      * Smaller bug fixes:
        * Added warnings for duplicate key errors when using INSERT IGNORE
        * Fixed bug when using --skip-log-bin followed by --log-bin, which did set log-bin to "0"
        * Allow one to see how cmake is called by using --just-print --just-configure

      * Fix [Bug #1009187](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1009187), [MDEV-373](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-373), mysql bug#58628
      * Analysis:
        * The queries in question use the \[unique | index]\_subquery execution methods.\
          These methods reuse the ref keys constructed by create\_ref\_for\_key(). The\
          way create\_ref\_for\_key() works is that it doesn't store in ref.key\_copy\[]\
          store\_key elements that represent constants. In particular it doesn't store\
          the store\_key for NULL constants.
        * The execution of \[unique | index]\_subquery calls\
          subselect\_uniquesubquery\_engine::copy\_ref\_key, which in addition to copy\
          the left IN argument into a index lookup key, is supposed to detect if\
          the left IN argument contains NULLs. Since the store\_key for the NULL\
          constant is not copied into the key array, the null is not detected, and\
          execution erroneously proceeds as if it should look for a complete match.
      * Solution:
        * The solution (unlike MySQL) is to reuse already computed information about\
          NULL presence. Item\_in\_optimizer::val\_int already finds out if the left IN\
          operand contains NULLs. The fix propagates this to the execution methods\
          subselect\_\[unique | index]subquery\_engine::exec so it knows if there were\
          NULL values independent of the presence of keys.
        * In addition the patch siplifies copy\_ref\_key() and the logic that hanldes\
          the case of NULLs in the left IN operand.
