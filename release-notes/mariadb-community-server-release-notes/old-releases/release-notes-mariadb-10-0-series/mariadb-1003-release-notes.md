**Release date:** 11 Jun 2013

[MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) is the current development version of MariaDB. It is built on the [MariaDB 5.5 series](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) with backported and reimplemented\
features from MySQL 5.6 and entirely new features not found anywhere else.

[MariaDB 10.0.3](mariadb-1003-release-notes.md) is an [_**Alpha**_](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) release.\
This is the fourth 10.0-based release, and we are releasing it now to get it\
into the hands of any who might want to test it. Not all features planned for\
the [MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) series are included in this release. Additional features will\
be pushed in future releases. **Do not use alpha releases on production systems.**

**For an overview of** [**MariaDB 10.0**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) **see the**[**What is MariaDB 10.0?**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) **page.**

For a list of changes made in [MariaDB 10.0.3](mariadb-1003-release-notes.md), with links to detailed\
information on each push, see the [changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-100-series/mariadb-1003-changelog.md).

## Based on [MariaDB 5.5](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md)

The [MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) series builds off of the [MariaDB 5.5](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) series. It also includes\
features imported from MySQL 5.6, and completely new features.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
