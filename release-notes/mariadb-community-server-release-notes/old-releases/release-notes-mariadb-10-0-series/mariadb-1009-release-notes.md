## Notable changes

[MariaDB 10.0.9](mariadb-1009-release-notes.md) is primarily a bug-fix and polishing release.

Notable changes of this release include:

* Fixes for the following security vulnerabilities:
  * [CVE-2014-4243](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4243)
  * [CVE-2014-2419](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2419)
  * [CVE-2014-0384](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0384)
  * [CVE-2014-2438](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2438)
  * [CVE-2014-2432](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2432)
* InnoDB upgraded to version 5.6.15
* [Extended-keys optimization ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/development-articles/mariadb-internals/mariadb-internals-documentation-query-optimizer/extended-keys)is now enabled by default.
* MariaDB can be compiled to use the system's [PCRE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/string-functions/regular-expressions-functions/pcre) library.
* Added [MASTER\_GTID\_WAIT()](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/miscellaneous-functions/master_gtid_wait) and [@@last\_gtid](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid).
* When a [TIME](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/time) value is casted to a [DATETIME](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime), the date part will be the [CURRENT\_DATE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/current_date), not `0000-00-00`. This is compatible with the SQL standard and MySQL-5.6. One can use [@@old\_mode=ZERO\_DATE\_TIME\_CAST](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/old-mode) to revert to the old behavior.
* [XtraDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) is now the default InnoDB implementation, Oracle InnoDB is a plugin that can be dynamically loaded if desired.
* Builds for Debian Sid and Ubuntu Trusty are being made available for the first time in the MariaDB [repositories](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/). For this release the Trusty packages are considered as alpha releases. The Sid packages will likely always be considered as such. Both were made as part of normal MariaDB development, and we're making them available for those that want to test or try them out.
