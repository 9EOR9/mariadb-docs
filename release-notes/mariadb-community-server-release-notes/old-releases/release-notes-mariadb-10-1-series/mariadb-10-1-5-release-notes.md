### New and Deprecated Distributions

As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](../../../mariadb-platform-deprecation-policy.md), this will\
be the final release of [MariaDB 10.1](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) for Fedora 19 "Schr√∂dinger's Cat", Ubuntu\
10.04 LTS "Lucid", and Mint 9 LTS "Isadora". When the next version of [MariaDB\
10.1](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) is released, repositories for these distributions will go away.

We have also added a couple of new Linux distributions with this release. Both\
Fedora 21 and Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid" repositories are now available. As this is\
the first release with these repositories, they are considered experimental.\
Please [let us know](https://mariadb.org/jira) if you run into any issues with\
them.

Repositories exist for 10.1, but because 10.1 is still Beta, they are not\
visible in the[repository configuration tool](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/).\
To configure a 10.1 apt, yum, or zypper repository using the tool, simply\
select 10.0 and then when executing the instructions, change all occurrences of\
'10.0' to '10.1'.
