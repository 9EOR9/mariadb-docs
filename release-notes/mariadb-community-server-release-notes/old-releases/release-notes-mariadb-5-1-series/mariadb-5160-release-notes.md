**Release date:** 5 Dec 2011

[MariaDB 5.1.60](mariadb-5160-release-notes.md) is a [Stable release](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md).In general this means\
there are no known serious bugs and we believe the code is ready for general\
usage. A "stable" MariaDB release is equivalent to a MySQL "GA" release.

**For a detailed description of** [**MariaDB 5.1**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md) **see the** [**What is MariaDB 5.1**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md) **page.**

Compared to [MariaDB 5.1.55](mariadb-5155-release-notes.md), [MariaDB 5.1.60](mariadb-5160-release-notes.md) is a\
bug-fix release.

information on each push, see the[MariaDB 5.1.60 Changelog](../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-51-series/mariadb-5160-changelog.md).

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
