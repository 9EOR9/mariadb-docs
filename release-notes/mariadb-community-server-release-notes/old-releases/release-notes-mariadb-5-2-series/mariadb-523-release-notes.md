**Update: New Packages for Debian and Ubuntu** _(22 Nov 2010)_\
A bug ([Bug #674413](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/674413)) was recently discovered with the Debian and Ubuntu packages of [MariaDB 5.2.3](mariadb-523-release-notes.md). Debian and Ubuntu packages with build identifier "mariadb87" in the package filename are affected. Updated packages have been created. The updated build number is 90. The updated packages are being pushed out to the [mirrors](https://askmonty.org/wiki/MariaDB:Download:MariaDB_5.2.3). The [Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-52-series/mariadb-523-changelog.md) has a link to the changes made to fix the bug.

This is a [stable release](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md). In general this means there are\
no known serious bugs and we believe the code is ready for general usage. For a high-level description of [MariaDB 5.2](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) see the [MariaDB 5.2 overview](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md).

See the [Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-52-series/mariadb-523-changelog.md) for a list of all changes included in this release.

## Includes [MariaDB 5.1.51](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5151-release-notes.md)

[MariaDB 5.2.3](mariadb-523-release-notes.md) has all changes from [MariaDB 5.1.50](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5150-release-notes.md) and MySQL 5.1.51.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

## Bugs Fixing

In addition to the differences noted in previous[release notes](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/release-notes/README.md) and [changelogs](../../../connectors/odbc/changelogs/), the main focus of this\
release was on fixing bugs. No new features were added to this release of[MariaDB 5.2](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md). The [changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-52-series/mariadb-522-changelog.md) has details on the specific bugs which were fixed.
