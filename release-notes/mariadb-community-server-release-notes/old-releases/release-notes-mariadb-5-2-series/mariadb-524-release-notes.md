This is a [stable release](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md). In general this means there are\
no known serious bugs and we believe the code is ready for general usage. For a high-level description of [MariaDB 5.2](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) see the [MariaDB 5.2 overview](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md).

See the [Changelog](../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-52-series/mariadb-524-changelog.md) for a list of all changes included in this release.

## Includes [MariaDB 5.1.53](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5153-release-notes.md)

[MariaDB 5.2.4](mariadb-524-release-notes.md) has all changes from [MariaDB 5.1.53](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5153-release-notes.md), including MySQL 5.1.53.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

## Includes [XtraDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-unmaintained/about-xtradb) 5.1.52-11.6

We have included XtraDB from Percona-server-5.1.52-11.6 in this version of\
MariaDB.

## New Packages

For this version of MariaDB we have started building Ubuntu 10.10 "Maverick"\
and Debian 6 "Squeeze" packages.
