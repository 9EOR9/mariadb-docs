[MariaDB 5.3.10](mariadb-5310-release-notes.md) is a [_**Stable**_](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) _**(GA)**_ release. In\
general this means that there are no known serious bugs, except for those\
marked as feature requests, that no bugs were fixed since last release that\
caused notable code changes, and that we believe the code is ready for\
general usage (based on bug inflow).

For a list of changes made in [MariaDB 5.3.10](mariadb-5310-release-notes.md), with links to detailed\
information on each push, see the[MariaDB 5.3.10 Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-53-series/mariadb-5310-changelog.md).

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

## Includes [MariaDB 5.2](../release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) and MySQL 5.1.66

This version of MariaDB includes the latest changes to [MariaDB 5.2](../release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md), and, by\
extension, [MariaDB 5.1](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md), including MySQL 5.1.66. See[Changes in MySQL 5.1.66](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-66.html)\
for what changed between this and previous MySQL versions.

## Bug fixes and other improvements

This MariaDB release includes several bug fixes and improvements. It is\
recommended for all users of [MariaDB 5.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3).

## Alternative Linux binaries

As with the previous version of [MariaDB 5.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3), this version includes alternative\
Linux binaries built on a different build machine. Binaries created on this box\
require at least GLIBC\_2.14. For continuity, we are still providing binaries\
built with the same toolchain (and on the same builder) as previous releases.\
The alternative binaries have a "(GLIBC\_2.14)" label to distinguish them from\
the others.
