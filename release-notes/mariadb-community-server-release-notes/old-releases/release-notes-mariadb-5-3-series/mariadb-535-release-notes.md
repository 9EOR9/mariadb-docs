**Release date:** 29 Feb 2012

[MariaDB 5.3.5](mariadb-535-release-notes.md) is a [**Stable**](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) (or _GA_) release. In\
general this means that there are no known serious bugs, except for those\
marked as feature requests and no bugs were fixed since the last release which\
caused any notable code changes. We believe the code is ready for general usage\
(based on bug inflow).

**For a detailed description of** [**MariaDB 5.3**](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/broken-reference/README.md) **see the** [**What is MariaDB 5.3**](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/broken-reference/README.md) **page.**

Compared to previous releases in the [MariaDB 5.3](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) series, [MariaDB 5.3.5](mariadb-535-release-notes.md) is\
primarily a bug-fix release with a focus on stability, performance, and\
usability. It is first **stable** or **GA** release of the 5.3 series and the\
fifth overall release in the series.

Apart from fixing bugs found in the previous 5.3.x _beta_ and _rc_\
releases, [MariaDB 5.3.5](mariadb-535-release-notes.md) introduces counters for the[Multi-Range Read](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/mariadb-internal-optimizations/multi-range-read-optimization#status-variables) and[Index Condition Pushdown](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/index-condition-pushdown#status-variables)\
optimizations.

For a list of every change made in [MariaDB 5.3.5](mariadb-535-release-notes.md), with links to detailed\
information on each push, see the[MariaDB 5.3.5 Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-53-series/mariadb-535-changelog.md). It is worth noting that[MariaDB 5.3](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) is built on [MariaDB 5.2](../release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md),[MariaDB 5.1](../release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-1.md), and MySQL 5.1.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
