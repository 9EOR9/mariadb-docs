**Release date:** 25 Feb 2012

[MariaDB 5.5.20](mariadb-5520-release-notes.md) is an [_**Alpha**_](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) release. [MariaDB 5.5.20](mariadb-5520-release-notes.md)-alpha is a merge of [MariaDB 5.3](../release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md) and MySQL 5.5 with some limited additional bug fixes. This is the first 5.5-based release, and we are releasing it now, intentionally without any extra features and with it missing some features, to get it into the hands of any who might want to test it. Extra features planned for [MariaDB 5.5](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) will be pushed into subsequent releases. **Do not use alpha releases on production systems.**

information on each push, see the[MariaDB 5.5.20 Changelog](../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-55-series/mariadb-5520-changelog.md).

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

**Note:** _There are no RPM packages of_ [_MariaDB 5.5.20_](mariadb-5520-release-notes.md) _available at this time._
