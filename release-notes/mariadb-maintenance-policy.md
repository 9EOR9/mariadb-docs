# MariaDB Maintenance Policy

The MariaDB project is a community project governed by the [MariaDB Foundation](https://mariadb.org). Please see the [Maintenance Policy](https://mariadb.org/about/maintenance-policy/) on the MariaDB Foundation website.

The MariaDB project is as active as the community around it and the MariaDB Foundation members actively working on and enhancing MariaDB. Therefore, from the MariaDB project perspective, the aspiration is for each major version of MariaDB to be maintained for quite a while after its initial stable (GA) version. For specific dates related to each version and more details, see the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](mariadb-platform-deprecation-policy.md). You may also want to review the MariaDB plc [Engineering Policies](https://mariadb.com/engineering-policies).

#### Additional Technical Support

MariaDB plc can of course offer additional Technical Support and Services to their customers that cover the versions even longer and provide SLA commitments for additional feeds. Please [contact us](https://mariadb.com/contact) for more details.
