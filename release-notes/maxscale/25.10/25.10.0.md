command.

### [MXS-5459](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5459) Test backup operation prerequisites

MariaDB Monitor
[backup commands](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/mariadb-monitor.md#backup-operations)
(rebuild-server, create-backup, restore-from-backup) now support key-value
arguments. The commands also support the *dry-run*-option, which checks if
MaxScale configuration and servers support the commands.

### [MXS-5456](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5456) Read maxctrl section from maxscale.cnf if present

If there is a `[maxctrl]` section in the MaxScale configuration file,
`maxctrl` will read settings from there.

### [MXS-5418](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5418) Add configuration option for assigning the initial server state

### [MXS-5393](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5393) Simplified way for issuing module commands

### [MXS-5367](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5367) Support zstd protocol compression

Zstd compression is now supported, so it can be used by compatible connectors.

### [MXS-5360](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5360) Enable implicit creation of filters

A filter that does not have any configuration settings can be
directory used in the configuration section of a service, without
a configuration section of its own. See the
[filter documentation](../../../maxscale/maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#filters)
for more information.

### [MXS-5354](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5354) Filter for controlling what statements are allowed

The
[readonly](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-filters/maxscale-readonly.md)
implicit filter can be used for preventing writes to a server.

### [MXS-5346](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5346) Property support [create|drop|list] indexes

The NoSQL protocol now supports the use of indexes.
See
[NoSQL indexes](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-protocols/maxscale-nosql-protocol-module.md#indexes)
for more information.

### [MXS-5334](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5334) Support MariaDB multi-factor authentication (logical AND)

### [MXS-5333](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5333) Support MariaDB multi-authentication (logical OR)

### [MXS-5330](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5330) Add database firewall

MaxScale now contains a
[database firewall](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-filters/maxscale-firewall-filter.md)
that first learns what statements are allowed and then rejects
statements that are not allowed.

### [MXS-5328](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5328) Galera cluster discovery

Added [discover-replicas](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/galera-monitor.md#discover-replicas) and
[bootstrap](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/galera-monitor.md#bootstrap) commands to Galera
Monitor. `bootstrap` populates an empty monitor. `discover-replicas` finds new
servers to add to the monitor and optionally removes disconnected servers.

### [MXS-5327](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5327) Replication cluster discovery

Added
[scan-topology](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/mariadb-monitor.md#scan-topology),
[discover-replicas](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/mariadb-monitor.md#discover-replicas)
and
[bootstrap](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/mariadb-monitor.md#bootstrap)
commands to MariaDB Monitor. `scan-topology` is mainly useful in checking
if all servers in the replication cluster are monitored. `bootstrap` populates
an empty monitor. `discover-replicas` finds new servers to add to the monitor
and optionally removes disconnected servers.

### [MXS-5240](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5240) React to redirect_url from backends

MaxScale will rename a `redirect_url` in the first OK packet from a server to
`redirect_mxs_url` before the packet is returned to clients. This is to prevent
someone from inadvertently bypassing MaxScale by doing a `SET GLOBAL redirect_url`
through MaxScale. Redirecting clients away from MaxScale, should be done via
`maxctrl alter service ... redirect_url=<URL>`.

### [MXS-5238](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5238) Connection redirection: add redirect_url parameter

MaxScale now has a
[redirect_url](../../../maxscale/maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#redirect_url)
configuration setting using which clients can be redirected away from MaxScale.

### [MXS-5230](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5230) Add a way to configure preference of servers

Using the new
[preferred_labels](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-routers/maxscale-readconnroute.md#preferred_labels)
it is possible to affect the server selection order in _ReadConnRoute_.

### [MXS-5220](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5220) Allow customization of fields in `maxctrl list` commands

With the `--fields` flag the output of _maxctrl_ can be customized. For instance:
```
maxctrl list servers --fields=server,connections,active-operations,gtid
```

### [MXS-5180](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5180) Add role support to monitors and services

Monitors and service will activate the configured role when logging in. See
[monitor](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/common-monitor-parameters.md#role) and
[service](../../../maxscale/maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#role) settings for more
information.

### [MXS-5177](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5177) Introduce a new core_file variable in MaxScale

By default, MaxScale no longer generates a core file when it crashes.
Please see
[core_file](../../../maxscale/maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#core_file)
for more information.

### [MXS-5170](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5170) Add setting to control servers participating in cooperative monitoring

[servers_no_cooperative_monitoring_locks](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors/mariadb-monitor.md#servers_no_cooperative_monitoring_locks)
excludes listed servers from cooperative monitoring.

### [MXS-5149](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5149) Include actual line content in parse error message

When configuration file parsing fails in an early phase, the actual offending
line will now be logged in the error message to make it easier to pinpoint
the problem.

### [MXS-5147](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5147) Lightweight GTID monitoring for causal_reads fast modes

### [MXS-5145](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5145) Clarify log messages regarding lost server locks

### [MXS-5130](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5130) Support for PARSEC auth plugin from MDEV-32618

MaxScale now supports
[PARSEC](../../../maxscale/reference/maxscale-authenticators/maxscale-parsec-authenticator.md)
authentication.

### [MXS-5015](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5015) Separate read-write/read-only and master/slave

In the output of `maxctrl list server`, the state of a server and _reason_
for the state are now separated. The state of a server is shown as `Read`,
`Write`, `Up` or `Down`, possibly augmented with `Maintenance` or
`Draining`|`Drained`, while the _reason_ for the state is shown in the
next column.
For instance, in a Primary/Replica cluster, the reason for the state `Read`
may be `Primary, read_only`, indicating that although the server is the
primary, it has `read_only` turned on, so it cannot be used for writing.

### [MXS-5013](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-5013) Reset router diagnostics statistics

Using maxctrl, it is now possible to clear both server and service
statistics.
```
$ maxctrl clear statistics MyService
$ maxctrl clear statistics Server1
```

### [MXS-4951](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4951) Support server side ephemeral certificates

### [MXS-4950](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4950) Support client side ephemeral certificates

### [MXS-4899](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4899) Make it possible to dump the query classifier cache to a file

Using maxctrl it is now possible to dump the content of the query classifier
cache to a file. The cache can be dumped as json, as pretty formatted json
and as json lines, i.e. as json objects separated by a newline.
```
$ maxctrl create qc_dump --format=json /tmp
/tmp/qc_dump-2024-09-23_13-00-30.json
```

### [MXS-4892](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4892) MaxScale should warn about inconsistencies in the configuration file

* At startup, if there are filters that are not used by any service,
  or servers that are not referred to by any service or monitor,
  a warning will be logged.

### [MXS-4754](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4754) Add replication information to maxctrl list servers

### [MXS-4699](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4699) Add global setting require_secure_transport

The global setting
[require_secure_transport](../../../maxscale/maxscale-management/deployment/maxscale-configuration-guide.md#require_secure_transport)
forces encryption to be configured everywhere.

### [MXS-4636](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4636) Mechanism for throttling of write queries based on replica lag

### [MXS-4371](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4371) Improve REST-API Access Control

### [MXS-4137](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4137) Run SQL commands on primary and replica whenever status changes

### [MXS-4102](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4102) Support for passphrase protected certificate keys
