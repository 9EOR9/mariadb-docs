# Server Constraints

## Overview

MariaDB Enterprise Server provides DDL (Data Definition Language) syntax to `create, alter, or drop` constraints.

In the context of `ISO 9075-2:2016`, this page uses "DDL (Data Definition Language)" to refer to SQL statements in the standard's "SQL-schema statements" group.

## Constraints

* [AUTO\_INCREMENT](auto_increment-constraints.md) Constraints
* [FOREIGN KEY](foreign-key-constraints.md) Constraints
* [NOT NULL](not-null-constraints.md) Constraints
* [PRIMARY KEY](primary-key-constraints.md) Constraints and Indexes
* [UNIQUE](unique-constraints-with-mariadb-enterprise-server.md) Constraints and Indexes
