# mariadb-waitpid

`mariadb_waitpid` is a utility for terminating processes.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It runs on Unix-like systems, making use of the `kill()` system call.
{% endhint %}

Previously, the client was called `mysql_waitpid`. It can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

## Usage

```
mariadb-waitpid [options] pid time
```

## Description

`mariadb-waitpid` sends signal `0` to the process _pid_ and waits up to _time_ seconds for the process to terminate. _pid_. _time_ must be positive integers.

Returns `0` if the process terminates in time or does not exist, and `1` otherwise.

Signal `1` is used if the `kill()` system call cannot handle signal `0`.
