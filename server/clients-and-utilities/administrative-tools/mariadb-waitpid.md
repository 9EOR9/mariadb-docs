# mariadb-waitpid

`mariadb_waitpid` is a utility for terminating processes. It runs on Unix-like systems, making use of the `kill()` system call.

Prior to [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client was called `mysql_waitpid`. It can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

## Usage

```
mariadb-waitpid [options] pid time
```

## Description

`mariadb-waitpid` sends signal 0 to the process _pid_ and waits up to _time_ seconds for the process to terminate. _pid_ and _time_ must be positive integers.

Returns 0 if the process terminates in time, or does not exist, and 1 otherwise.

Signal 1 is used if the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0
