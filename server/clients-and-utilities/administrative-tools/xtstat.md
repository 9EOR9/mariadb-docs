# xtstat

`xtstat` can be used to monitor all internal activity of [PBXT](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/PBXT).

`xtstat` polls the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PBXT_STATISTICS` table. The poll interval can be set using the `--delay` option, and is 1 second by default.

For most statistics, `xtstat` will display the difference in values between the current and previous polls. For example, if bytes written current value is 1000, and on the previous call it was 800, then `xtstat` will display 200. This means that 200 bytes were written to disk in the intervening period.

## Using `xtstat`

Invoke xtstat as follows:

```
$ xtstat [ options ]
```

For example, to poll every 10 seconds:

```
xtstat -D10
```

Note that statistic counters are never reset, even if a rollback occurs. For example, if an `UPDATE` statement is rolled back, `xtstat` will still indicate that one write statement (see stat-write below) was executed.

If MariaDB shuts down or crashes, `xtstat` will attempt to reconnect. `xtstat` can be terminated any time using the `CTRL-C` key cimbination.

Before [PBXT](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/server/clients-and-utilities/PBXT/README.md) has recovered, not all statistics are available. In particular, the statistics relating to PBXT background threads are not available (including the `sweep` and `chkpnt` statistics).

### Command line options

`xtstat` options are as follows:

| Option                  | Description                                                                                  |

| -S, --socket=value      | Socket file to use for connection.                                                           |

Connection options will also be taken from the MySQL config file if available.

#### Size indicators

Values displayed by `xtstat` are either a time in milliseconds, a value in bytes, or a counter. If these values are too large to be displayed then the value is rounded and a size indicator is added.

The following size indicators are used:

|   |   |                                     |
| - | - | ----------------------------------- |
| K | : | Kilobytes (1,024 bytes)             |
| M | : | Megabytes (1,048,576 bytes)         |
| G | : | Gigabytes (1,073,741,024 bytes)     |
| T | : | Terabytes (1,099,511,627,776 bytes) |
| t | : | thousands (1,000s)                  |
| m | : | millions (1,000,000s)               |
| b | : | billions (1,000,000,000s)           |

### Statistics

The following is a list of the statistics displayed by `xtstat`. Each statistic as a two-part display name. The first part is the category and the second part is the type.

You can select categories and types for display, as you require. For example `--display=read` will display all read activity, `--display=xact|stat` will display transaction and statement activity.

Note, for diagnostics it is best to capture all statistics. The reason is because you never now where a problem might turn up, so without certain statistics you may not be able to identify the problem.
