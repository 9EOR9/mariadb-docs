# aria\_pack

`aria_pack` is a tool for compressing [Aria](../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/) tables. The resulting tables are read-only, and usually about 40% to 70% smaller.

`aria_pack` is run as follows:

```
aria_pack [options] file_name [file_name2...]
```

The file name is the `.MAI` index file. The extension can be omitted, although keeping it permits wildcards, for instance to compress all the files, such as:

```
aria_pack *.MAI
```

`aria_pack` compresses each column separately. This means, when the resulting data is read, only the individual rows and columns required need to be decompressed, allowing for quicker reading.

Once a table has been packed, use [aria\_chk -rq](aria_chk.md) (the quick and recover options) to rebuild its indexes.

## Options

The following variables can be set as command line options to `aria_pack`, or set in the `[ariapack]` section in your [my.cnf](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md) file:

## Unpacking

To unpack a table compressed with aria\_pack, use the [aria\_chk -u](aria_chk.md) option.

## Example

```
> aria_pack /my/data/test/posts
Compressing /my/data/test/posts.MAD: (1690 records)
- Calculating statistics
- Compressing file
37.71%     
> aria_chk -rq --ignore-control-file /my/data/test/posts
- check record delete-chain
- recovering (with keycache) Aria-table '/my/data/test/posts'
Data records: 1690
State updated
```
