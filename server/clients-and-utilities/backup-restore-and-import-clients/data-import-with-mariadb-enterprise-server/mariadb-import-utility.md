Before MariaDB Import can be installed on Linux, a MariaDB repository must be configured. MariaDB Corporation offers multiple repositories:
**For MariaDB Corporation customers, the MariaDB Enterprise Repository is available.**For anyone else, the MariaDB Community Repository is publicly available.


For additional information on how to configure a MariaDB repository, see "Configure MariaDB Repository".


2. Install MariaDB Import and package dependencies.

# Import Data


The procedure to import data depends on the operating system.


## Linux


1. Determine the connection parameters for your MariaDB Enterprise Server database.


2. Use MariaDB Import with the connection information to import the data from the TSV or CSV file into your MariaDB Enterprise Server database:


```
$ mariadb-import --host FULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME --port TCP_PORT \
      --user DATABASE_USER --password \
      --ssl-verify-server-cert \
      --ssl-ca ~/PATH_TO_PEM_FILE \
      --local \
      --ignore-lines=1 \
      accounts contacts.tsv
```

**Replace `FULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME` with the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name of your database** Replace `TCP_PORT` with the TCP port of your database
**Replace `DATABASE_USER` with the username for your database user account** If TLS is required, replace `/PATH_TO_PEM_FILE` with the path to the certificate authority chain (.pem) file
**If your file is a CSV file, rather than a TSV file, specify `--fields-terminated-by=`,** Specify the database name as the first argument (from above, accounts)
**The table name is extracted from the TSV or CSV file's basename (from above, contacts)**


3. After the command is executed, you will be prompted for the password of your database user account.


## Windows


1. Fix your executable search path.


On Windows, MariaDB Import is not typically found in the executable search path by default. You must find its installation path, and add that path to the executable search path:


```
$ SET "PATH=C:\Program Files\MariaDB 10.6\bin;%PATH%"
```

2. Determine the connection parameters for your MariaDB Enterprise Server database.


3. Use MariaDB Import with the connection information to import the data from the TSV or CSV file into your MariaDB Enterprise Server database:


```
$ mariadb-import --host FULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME --port TCP_PORT \
      --user DATABASE_USER --password \
      --ssl-verify-server-cert \
      --ssl-ca ~/PATH_TO_PEM_FILE \
      --local \
      --ignore-lines=1 \
      accounts contacts.tsv
```

**Replace `FULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME` with the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name of your database** Replace `TCP_PORT` with the TCP port of your database
**Replace `DATABASE_USER` with the username for your database user account** Replace `/PATH_TO_PEM_FILE` with the path to the certificate authority chain (.pem) file
**If your file is a CSV file, rather than a TSV file, specify --fields-terminated-by=,** Specify the database name as the first argument (from above, accounts)
**The table name is extracted from the TSV or CSV file's basename (from above, contacts)**


4. After the command is executed, you will be prompted for the password of your database user account.
