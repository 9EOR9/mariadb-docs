# mariadb-dump

The `mariadb-dump` client is a backup program originally written by Igor Romanenko.

Prior to [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client used to be called `mysqldump`, and can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

**MariaDB starting with** [**11.0.1**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-0-series/mariadb-11-0-1-release-notes)

From [MariaDB 11.0.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-0-series/mariadb-11-0-1-release-notes), `mysqldump` (the symlink) is deprecated and removed from the `mariadb` Docker Official Image.

**Note:** From [MariaDB 10.5.25](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-10-5-25-release-notes), [MariaDB 10.6.18](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-10-6-18-release-notes), [MariaDB 10.11.8](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-8-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.0.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-0-series/mariadb-11-0-6-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.1.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-1-series/mariadb-11-1-5-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.2.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/mariadb-11-2-4-release-notes) and [MariaDB 11.4.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-11-4-series/mariadb-11-4-2-release-notes) `mariadb-dump` generates a command at the beginning of the dump to enable [sandbox](../mariadb-client/mariadb-command-line-client.md#-sandbox) mode. This command cannot be interpreted by earlier versions of the [MariaDB command line client](../mariadb-client/mariadb-command-line-client.md) or by MySQL's command line client, and the client will generate an error if used against the versions that do not support it. This does not affect other methods of importing the data.

The `mariadb-dump` client can be used to dump a database or a collection of databases for backup or transfer to another database server (not necessarily MariaDB or MySQL). The dump typically contains SQL statements to create the table, populate it, or both. However, `mariadb-dump` can also be used to generate files in CSV, other delimited text, or XML format.

If you are doing a backup on the server and your tables all are [MyISAM](../../reference/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables, consider using [mariadb-hotcopy](mariadb-hotcopy.md) instead because it can accomplish faster backups and faster restores.

mariadb-dump dumps triggers along with tables, as these are part of the table definition. However, [stored procedures](../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/), [views](../../server-usage/views/), and [events](../../server-usage/triggers-events/event-scheduler/events.md) are not, and need extra parameters to be recreated explicitly (for example, `--routines` and `--events`). [Procedures](../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/) and [functions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/functions) are however also part of the system tables (for example [mysql.proc](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-proc-table.md)).

`mariadb-dump` supports the [enhancements for START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT](../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/enhancements-for-start-transaction-with-consistent-snapshot.md#mariadb-dump).

## Performance

mariadb-dump doesn't usually consume much CPU resources on modern hardware as by default it uses a single thread. This method is good for a heavily loaded server.

Disk input/outputs per second (IOPS), can however increase for multiple reasons. When you back-up on the same device as the database, this produces unnecessary random IOPS. The dump is done sequentially, on a per table basis, causing a full-table scan and many buffer page misses on tables that are not fully cached in memory.

It's recommended that you back-up from a network location to remove disk IOPS on the database server, but it is vital to use a separate network card to keep network bandwidth available for regular traffic.

Although mariadb-dump will by default preserve your resources for regular spindle disks and low-core hardware, this doesn't mean that concurrent dumps cannot benefit from hardware architecture like SAN, flash storage, low write workload. The back-up time would benefit from a tool such as MyDumper.

## Usage

There are four general ways to invoke `mariadb-dump`:

```
shell> mariadb-dump [options] db_name [tbl_name ...]
shell> mariadb-dump [options] --databases db_name ...
shell> mariadb-dump [options] --all-databases
shell> mariadb-dump [options] --system=[option_list]
```

If you do not name any tables following db\_name or if you use the`--databases` or `--all-databases` option, entire\
databases are dumped.

`mariadb-dump` does not dump the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA (or PERFORMANCE\_SCHEMA, if enabled) database by default. MariaDB dumps the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` if you name it explicitly on the command line, although currently you must also use the `--skip-lock-tables` option.

To see a list of the options your version of `mariadb-dump` supports, execute `mariadb-dump --help`.

### Row by Row vs. Buffering

`mariadb-dump` can retrieve and dump table contents row by row,\
or it can retrieve the entire content from a table and buffer it in memory\
before dumping it. Buffering in memory can be a problem if you are dumping\
large tables. To dump tables row by row, use the `--quick`\
option (or `--opt`, which enables `--quick`).\
The `--opt` option (and hence `--quick`) is\
enabled by default, so to enable memory buffering, use`--skip-quick`.

### mariadb-dump and the mysql.transaction\_registry\_table

`mariadb-dump` includes logic to cater for the [mysql.transaction\_registry table](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-transaction_registry-table.md). `mysqldump` from an earlier MariaDB release cannot be used on [MariaDB 10.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/what-is-mariadb-103) and beyond.

### mariadb-dump and Old Versions of MySQL

If you are using a recent version of `mariadb-dump` to generate a\
dump to be reloaded into a very old MySQL server, you should not use the`--opt` or `--extended-insert` option. Use`--skip-opt` instead.

### Options

`mariadb-dump` supports the following options:

| Option                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| --compatible=name                    | Change the dump to be compatible with a given mode. By default tables are dumped in a format optimized for MariaDB and MySQL. Legal modes are: ansi, mysql323, mysql40, postgresql, oracle, mssql, db2, maxdb, no\_key\_options, no\_table\_options, and no\_field\_options. One can use several modes separated by commas.This option does not guarantee compatibility with other servers.

[CREATE DATABASE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-database.md) and [USE](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/use-database.md) statements are included in the output before each new database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -#, --debug\[=#]                     | If using a debug version of MariaDB, write a debugging log. A typical debug\_options string is ´d:t:o,file\_name´. The default value is ´d:t:o,/tmp/mysqldump.trace´.

| --dir                                | Parallel dump of multiple databases. Works just like --tab, with regard to output (sql file for table definition and tab-separated for data, same options, e.g --parallel). It also allows the --databases and --all-databases options. When --dir is used, it creates the directory structure in the output directory pointed to by --dir. For every database to be dumped, there will be a directory with the database name. All options that --tab supports are also supported by --dir, in particular --parallel.

Until this option, mariadb-dump could not read historical rows from versioned tables, and so historical data would not be backed up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --dump-slave\[=value]                | Used for producing a dump file from a replica server that can be used to set up another replica server with the same primary. Causes the [binary log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) position and filename of the primary to be appended to the dumped data output. Setting the value to 1 (the default) will print it as a [CHANGE MASTER](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/replication-statements/change-master-to.md) command in the dumped data output; if set to 2, that command will be prefixed with a comment symbol. This option will turn --lock-all-tables on, unless --single-transaction is specified too (in which case a global read lock is only taken a short time at the beginning of the dump - don't forget to read about --single-transaction below). In all cases any action on logs will happen at the exact moment of the dump. Option automatically turns --lock-tables off. Using this option causes mariadb-dump to stop the replica SQL thread before beginning the dump, and restart it again after completion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Defaults to on; use --skip-extended-insert to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| -F, --flush-logs                     | Flush the MariaDB server log files before starting the dump. This option requires the RELOAD privilege. If you use this option in combination with the --databases= or --all-databases option, the logs are flushed for each database dumped. The exception is when using --lock-all-tablesor --master-data: In this case, the logs are flushed only once, corresponding to the moment all tables are locked. If you want your dump and the log flush to happen at the same exact moment, you should use --flush-logs together with either --lock-all-tables or --master-data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| -f, --force                          | Continue even if an SQL error occurs during a table dump.One use for this option is to cause mariadb-dump to continue executing even when it encounters a view that has become invalid because the definition refers to a table that has been dropped. Without --force in this example, mariadb-dump exits with an error message. With --force, mariadb-dump prints the error message, but it also writes an SQL comment containing the view definition to the dump output and continues executing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --gtid                               | Used together with --master-data and --dump-slave to more conveniently set up a new [GTID](../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) replica. It causes those options to output SQL statements that configure the replica to use the [global transaction ID](../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) to connect to the primary instead of old-style filename/offset positions. The old-style positions are still included in comments when --gtid is used; likewise the GTID position is included in comments even if --gtid is not used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| -l, --lock-tables                    | For each dumped database, lock all tables to be dumped before dumping them. The tables are locked with READ LOCAL to allow concurrent inserts in the case of [MyISAM](../../reference/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables. For transactional tables such as [InnoDB](../../reference/storage-engines/innodb/), --single-transaction is a much better option than --lock-tables because it does not need to lock the tables at all.Because --lock-tables locks tables for each database separately, this option does not guarantee that the tables in the dump file are logically consistent between databases. Tables in different databases may be dumped in completely different states. Use --skip-lock-tables to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| --master-data\[=#]                   | Causes the [binary log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) position and filename to be appended to the output, useful for dumping a primary replication server to produce a dump file that can be used to set up another server as a replica of the primary. These are the primary server coordinates from which the replica should start replicating after you load the dump file into the replica. If the option is set to 1 (the default), will print it as a [CHANGE MASTER](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/replication-statements/change-master-to.md) command; if set to 2, that command will be prefixed with a comment symbol. This --master-data option will turn --lock-all-tables on, unless --single-transaction is specified too. Before [MariaDB 5.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3) this would take a global read lock for a short time at the beginning of the dump - see [Enhancements for START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT](../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/enhancements-for-start-transaction-with-consistent-snapshot.md) and the --single-transaction option below). In all cases, any action on logs will happen at the exact moment of the dump. This option automatically turns --lock-tables off. In all cases, any action on logs happens at the exact moment of the dump. It is also possible to set up a replica by dumping an existing replica of the primary. To do this, use the following procedure on the existing replica:1. Stop the replica's SQL thread and get its current status:mariadb> STOP SLAVE SQL\_THREAD;mariadb> SHOW SLAVE STATUS;2. From the output of the SHOW SLAVE STATUS statement, the binary log coordinates of the primary server from which the new replica should start replicating are the values of the Relay\_Master\_Log\_File and Exec\_Master\_Log\_Pos fields. Denote those values as file\_name and file\_pos.2. Dump the replica server:shell> mariadb-dump --master-data=2 --all-databases > dumpfile3. Restart the replica:mariadb> START SLAVE;4. On the new replica, load the dump file:shell> mariadb < dumpfile5. On the new replica, set the replication coordinates to those of the primary server obtained earlier:mariadb> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER\_LOG\_FILE = ´file\_name´, MASTER\_LOG\_POS = file\_pos; The CHANGE MASTER TO statement might also need other parameters, such as MASTER\_HOST to point the replica to the correct primary server host.

| --opt                                | This option is shorthand. It is the same as specifying --add-drop-table, --add-locks, --create-options, --quick, --extended-insert, --lock-tables, --set-charset, and --disable-keys. Enabled by default, disable with --skip-opt. It should give you a fast dump operation and produce a dump file that can be reloaded into a MariaDB server quickly.The --opt option is enabled by default. Use --skip-opt to disable it. See the discussion at the beginning of this section for information about selectively enabling or disabling a subset of the options affected by --opt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --order-by-primary                   | Sorts each table's rows by primary key, or first unique key, if such a key exists.

| --order-by-size                      | Dump each table according to their size, smallest first. Useful when using --single-transaction on tables which get truncated/altered often. The assumption here is that smaller tables get truncated more often, and by dumping those first, this reduces the chance that a --single-transaction dump will fail with with 'Table definition has changed, please retry transaction'.

| -j, --parallel=#                     | Number of dump table jobs executed in parallel (only for use with the --tab option). Initial testing indicates that performance can be increased (dump time decreased) up to 4 times on smaller size dumps, when the database fits into memory. There is a point at which disk becomes the bottleneck, after which adding more parallel jobs does not bring better performance.

| -p\[passwd], --password\[=passwd     | The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option and the password. If you omit the password value following the --password or -p option on the command line, mariadb-dump prompts for one.Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on the command line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| -q, --quick                          | This option is useful for dumping large tables. It forces mariadb-dump to retrieve rows for a table from the server a row at a time and to then dump the results directly to stdout rather than retrieving the entire row set and buffering it in memory before writing it out. Defaults to on, use --skip-quick to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The result file is created and its previous contents overwritten, even if an error occurs while generating the dump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -R, --routines                       | Include stored routines ([procedures](../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/) and [functions](../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-functions/)) for the dumped databases in the output. Use of this option requires the SELECT privilege for the [mysql.proc](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-proc-table.md) table. The output generated using --routines contains [CREATE PROCEDURE](../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/create-procedure.md) and [CREATE FUNCTION](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-function.md) statements to re-create the routines. However, these statements do not include attributes such as the routine creation and modification timestamps. This means that when the routines are reloaded, they will be created with the timestamps equal to the reload time.If you require routines to be re-created with their original timestamp attributes, do not use --routines. Instead, dump and reload the contents of the [mysql.proc](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-proc-table.md) table directly, using a MariaDB account which has appropriate privileges for the mysql database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| --single-transaction                 | This option sends a [START TRANSACTION](../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/start-transaction.md) SQL statement to the server before dumping data. It is useful only with transactional tables such as [InnoDB](../../reference/storage-engines/innodb/), because then it dumps the consistent state of the database at the time when BEGIN was issued without blocking any applications.When using this option, you should keep in mind that only InnoDB tables are dumped in a consistent state. The single-transaction feature depends not only on the engine being transactional and capable of REPEATABLE-READ, but also on START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT. The dump is not guaranteed to be consistent for other storage engines. For example, any [TokuDB](../../reference/storage-engines/tokudb/), [MyISAM](../../reference/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) or [MEMORY](../../reference/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) tables dumped while using this option may still change state.While a --single-transaction dump is in process, to ensure a valid dump file (correct table contents and binary log coordinates), no other connection should use the following statements: [ALTER TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md), [CREATE TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md), [DROP TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-table.md), [RENAME TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/rename-table.md), or [TRUNCATE TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/table-statements/truncate-table.md). A consistent read is not isolated from those statements, so use of them on a table to be dumped can cause the SELECT (performed by mariadb-dump to retrieve the table contents) to obtain incorrect contents or fail.The --single-transaction option and the --lock-tables option are mutually exclusive because [LOCK TABLES](../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/lock-tables.md) causes any pending transactions to be committed implicitly. So this option automatically turns off --lock-tablesTo dump large tables, you should combine the --single-transaction option with --quick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In order to verify the server certificate, the user must specify the --ssl-verify-server-cert option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| --ssl-capath=name                    | Defines a path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files that should each contain one X509 certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. The directory specified by this option needs to be run through the [openssl rehash](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/rehash.html) command.

The option values here are from the set of all, users, plugins, udfs, servers, stats, timezones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -T, --tab=name                       | Produce tab-separated text-format data files. With this option, for each dumped table mariadb-dump will create a tbl\_name.sql file containing the CREATE TABLE statement that creates the table, and a tbl\_name.txt file containing the table's data. The option value is the directory in which to write the files.Note: This option can only be used when mariadb-dump/ is run on the same machine as the mariadbd server. You must have the FILE privilege, and the server must have permission to write files in the directory that you specify.By default, the .txt data files are formatted using tab characters between column values and a newline at the end of each line. The format can be specified explicitly using the --fields-xxx and --lines-terminated-by options. Column values are converted to the character set specified by the --default-character-set option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| --tz-utc                             | This option enables [TIMESTAMP](../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/timestamp.md) columns to be dumped and reloaded between servers in different time zones. mariadb-dump sets its connection time zone to UTC and adds SET TIME\_ZONE=´+00:00´ to the dump file. Without this option, TIMESTAMP columns are dumped and reloaded in the time zones local to the source and destination servers, which can cause the values to change if the servers are in different time zones. --tz-utc also protects against changes due to daylight saving time. --tz-utc is enabled by default. To disable it, use --skip-tz-utc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Group Options

Some `mariadb-dump` options are shorthand for groups of other options:

* Use of `--opt` is the same as specifying`--add-drop-table`, `--add-locks`,`--create-options`, `--disable-keys`,`--extended-insert`, `--lock-tables`,`--quick`, and `--set-charset`. All of the\
  options that `--opt` stands for also are on by default\
  because `--opt` is on by default.
* Use of `--compact` is the same as specifying`--skip-add-drop-table`,`--skip-add-locks`, `--skip-comments`,`--skip-disable-keys`, and`--skip-set-charset` options.

To reverse the effect of a group option, uses its `--skip-xxx`\
form (`--skip-opt` or `--skip-compact`). It\
is also possible to select only part of the effect of a group option by\
following it with options that enable or disable specific features. Here are\
some examples:

* To select the effect of `--opt` except for some features,\
  use the `--skip` option for each feature. To disable\
  extended inserts and memory buffering, use `--opt--skip-extended-insert` `--skip-quick`.\
  (Actually, `--skip-extended-insert--skip-quick` is sufficient because`--opt` is on by default.)
* To reverse `--opt` for all features except index disabling\
  and table locking, use `--skip-opt--disable-keys` `--lock-tables`.

When you selectively enable or disable the effect of a group option, order is\
important because options are processed first to last. For example,`--disable-keys` `--lock-tables--skip-opt` would not have the intended effect; it is the\
same as `--skip-opt` by itself.

#### Special Characters in Option Values

Some options, like `--lines-terminated-by`, accept a string. The string can be quoted, if necessary. For example, on Unix systems this is the option to enclose fields within double quotes:

```
--fields-enclosed-by='"'
```

An alternative to specify the hexadecimal value of a character. For example, the following syntax works on any platform:

```
--fields-enclosed-by=0x22
```

### Option Files

In addition to reading options from the command-line, `mariadb-dump` can also read options from [option files](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md). If an unknown option is provided to `mariadb-dump` in an option file, then it is ignored.

The following options relate to how MariaDB command-line tools handles option files. They must be given as the first argument on the command-line:

| Option                    | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Option                    | Description                                                                         |
| --print-defaults          | Print the program argument list and exit.                                           |
| --no-defaults             | Don't read default options from any option file.                                    |
| --defaults-file=#         | Only read default options from the given file #.                                    |
| --defaults-extra-file=#   | Read this file after the global files are read.                                     |
| --defaults-group-suffix=# | In addition to the default option groups, also read option groups with this suffix. |

`mariadb-dump` is linked with [MariaDB Connector/C](../../../kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-c/). However, MariaDB Connector/C does not yet handle the parsing of option files for this client. That is still performed by the server option file parsing code. See [MDEV-19035](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19035) for more information.

#### Option Groups

`mariadb-dump` reads options from the following [option groups](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md#option-groups) from [option files](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Group             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| \[mysqldump]      | Options read by mariadb-dump, which includes both MariaDB Server and MySQL Server.                                                                                                                            |
| \[mariadb-dump]   | Options read by mariadb-dump.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| \[client]         | Options read by all MariaDB and MySQL [client programs](../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/), which includes both MariaDB and MySQL clients. For example, mysqldump.                                            |
| \[client-server]  | Options read by all MariaDB [client programs](../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/) and the MariaDB Server. This is useful for options like socket and port, which is common between the server and the clients. |
| \[client-mariadb] | Options read by all MariaDB [client programs](../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/).                                                                                                                             |

### NULL, ´NULL´, and Empty Values in XML

For a column named `column_name`, the `NULL` value, an empty string, and\
the string value `´NULL´` are distinguished from one another in the output\
generated by this option as follows.

| Value                 | XML Representation |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Value                 | XML Representation |
| NULL (unknown value)  |                    |
| ´´ (empty string)     |                    |
| ´NULL´ (string value) | NULL               |

The output from the mariadb client when run using\
the `--xml` option also follows the preceding rules.

XML output from mariadb-dump includes the XML namespace, as shown here :

```

### Restoring

To restore a backup created with mariadb-dump, use the [mariadb client](../mariadb-client/mariadb-command-line-client.md) to import the dump, for example:

```
mariadb db_name < backup-file.sql
```

## Variables

You can also set the following variables\
(`--variable-name=value`) and boolean options `{FALSE|TRUE}` by using:

## Examples

A common use of `mariadb-dump` is for making a backup of an entire database:

```
shell> mariadb-dump db_name > backup-file.sql
```

You can load the dump file back into the server like this:

```
shell> mariadb db_name < backup-file.sql
```

Or like this:

```
shell> mariadb -e "source /path-to-backup/backup-file.sql" db_name
```

`mariadb-dump` is also very useful for populating databases by\
copying data from one MariaDB server to another:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --opt db_name | mariadb --host=remote_host -C db_name
```

It is possible to dump several databases with one command:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --databases db_name1 [db_name2 ...] > my_databases.sql
```

To dump all databases, use the `--all-databases` option:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --all-databases > all_databases.sql
```

For InnoDB tables, `mariadb-dump` provides a way of making an\
online backup:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --all-databases --single-transaction all_databases.sql
```

This backup acquires a global read lock on all tables (using`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`) at the beginning of the dump. As\
soon as this lock has been acquired, the binary log coordinates are read and\
the lock is released. If long updating statements are running when the FLUSH\
statement is issued, the MariaDB server may get stalled until those statements\
finish. After that, the dump becomes lock free and does not disturb reads and\
writes on the tables. If the update statements that the MariaDB server receives\
are short (in terms of execution time), the initial lock period should not be\
noticeable, even with many updates.

For point-in-time recovery (also known as “roll-forward,” when you need to\
restore an old backup and replay the changes that happened since that backup),\
it is often useful to rotate the [binary log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) or at least know the binary log coordinates to which the dump corresponds:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --all-databases --master-data=2 > all_databases.sql
```

Or:

```
shell> mariadb-dump --all-databases --flush-logs --master-data=2 > all_databases.sql
```

The `--master-data` and `--single-transaction`\
options can be used simultaneously, which provides a convenient way to make an\
online backup suitable for use prior to point-in-time recovery if tables are\
stored using the InnoDB storage engine.
