# mariadb-import

`mariadb-import` loads tables from text files in various formats.

{% hint style="info" %}
Previously, the client was called `mysqlimport`. It can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.
{% endhint %}

`mariadb-import` loads tables from text files in various formats. The base name of the text file must be the name of the table that should be used. If one uses sockets to connect to the MariaDB server, the server will open and read the text file directly. In other cases the client will open the text file. The SQL statement [LOAD DATA INFILE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/load-data-into-tables-or-index/load-data-infile.md) is used to import the rows.

## Usage

The command to use `mariadb-import` and the general syntax is:

```bash
mariadb-import [OPTIONS] database textfile1 [textfile2 ...]
```

## Options

`mariadb-import` supports the following options:

#### `--character-sets-dir`=_directory_

_Directory_ for character set files.

#### `-c` _cols_, `--columns`=_cols_

Use only these columns to import the data to. Give the column names in a comma separated list. This is same as giving columns to [LOAD DATA INFILE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/load-data-into-tables-or-index/load-data-infile.md).

#### `-C`, `--compress`

Use compression in server/client protocol.

#### `--database`=_database_

Restore the specified database, ignoring others.To specify more than one database to include, use the directive multiple times, once for each database. Only takes effect when used together with the `--dir` option. This option is available from MariaDB 11.6.

#### `--debug`\[=options]

Output debug log. Often this is `d:t:o,filename`. The default is `d:t:o`.

#### `--debug-check`

Check memory and open file usage at exit.

#### `--debug-info`

Print some debug info at exit.

#### `--default-auth`=_plugin_

Default authentication client-side _plugin_ to use.

#### `--default-character-set`=_character-set_

Set the default [_character set_](../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/).

#### `--fields-terminated-by`=_string_

Fields in the input file are terminated by the given _string_.

#### `--fields-enclosed-by`=_character_

Fields in the import file are enclosed by the given _character_.

#### `--fields-optionally-enclosed-by`=_character_

Fields in the input file are optionally enclosed by the given _character_.

#### `--fields-escaped-by`=_character_

Fields in the input file are escaped by the given _character_.

If duplicate unique key was found, keep old row.

#### `-k`, `--ignore-foreign-keys`

Disable foreign key checks while importing the data.

#### `--ignore-database`=_database_

The `--ssl` option does not enable [verifying the server certificate](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#server-certificate-verification) by default. In order to verify the server certificate, the user must specify the `--ssl-verify-server-cert` option.

#### `--ssl-ca`=_pem-file_

Define a path to a _PEM file_ that should contain one or more X509 certificates for trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Authorities (CAs)](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-authorities-cas) for more information. This option implies the `--ssl` option.

#### `--ssl-capath`=_pem-directory_

Define a _path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files_ that should each contain one X509 certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. The directory specified by this option needs to be run through the [openssl rehash](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/rehash.html) command. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Authorities (CAs)](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-authorities-cas) for more information. This option is only supported if the client was built with OpenSSL or yaSSL. If the client was built with GnuTLS or Schannel, then this option is not supported. See [TLS and Cryptography Libraries Used by MariaDB](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/tls-and-cryptography-libraries-used-by-mariadb.md) for more information about which libraries are used on which platforms. This option implies the `--ssl` option. |

#### `--ssl-cert`=_file_

Define a path to the X509 _certificate file_ to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. This option implies the `--ssl` option.

#### `--ssl-cipher`=_cipher-list_

Defines a path to a _PEM file_ that should contain one or more revoked X509 certificates to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-revocation-lists-crls) for more information. This option is only supported if the client was built with OpenSSL or Schannel. If the client was built with yaSSL or GnuTLS, then this option is not supported. See [TLS and Cryptography Libraries Used by MariaDB](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/tls-and-cryptography-libraries-used-by-mariadb.md) for more information about which libraries are used on which platforms.

#### `--ssl-crlpath`=_pem-directory_

Define a _path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files_ that should each contain one revoked X509 certificate to use for [TLS](../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. The directory specified by this option needs to be run through the [openssl rehash](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/rehash.html) command.

### Option Files

In addition to reading options from the command line, `mariadb-import` can also read options from [option files](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md). If an unknown option is provided to `mariadb-import` in an option file, then it is ignored.

The following options relate to how MariaDB command line tools handles option files. They must be given as the first argument on the command line:

| Option                    | Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--print-defaults`        | Print the program argument list and exit.        |
| `--no-defaults`           | Don't read default options from any option file. |
| `--defaults-file`=#       | Only read default options from the given file #. |
| `--defaults-extra-file`=# | Read this file after the global files are read.  |

`mariadb-import` is linked with MariaDB Connector/C. Therefore, it may be helpful to see [Configuring MariaDB Connector/C with Option Files](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-c/configuring-mariadb-connectorc-with-option-files) for more information on how MariaDB Connector/C handles option files.

### Option Groups

`mariadb-import` reads options from the following [option groups](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md#option-groups) from [option files](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):
