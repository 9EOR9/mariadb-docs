The Ocelot GUI (ocelotgui), a database client, allows users to connect to a MySQL or MariaDB DBMS server, enter SQL statements, and receive results. Some of its features are: syntax highlighting, user-settable colors and fonts for each part of the screen, result-set displays with multi-line rows and resizable columns, and a debugger.
