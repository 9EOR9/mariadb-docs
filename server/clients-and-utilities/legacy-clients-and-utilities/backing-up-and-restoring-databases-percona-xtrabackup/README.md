# Percona XtraBackup

{% hint style="danger" %}
Percona XtraBackup is **not supported** in MariaDB. [mariadb-backup](../../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup/) is the recommended backup method to use instead of Percona XtraBackup. See [Percona XtraBackup Overview: Compatibility with MariaDB](percona-xtrabackup-overview.md#compatibility-with-mariadb) for more information.
