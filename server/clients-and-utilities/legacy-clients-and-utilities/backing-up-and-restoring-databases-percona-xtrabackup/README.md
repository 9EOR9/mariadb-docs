# Percona XtraBackup

Percona XtraBackup is **not supported** in MariaDB. [Mariabackup](../../../server-management/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariabackup/README.md) is the recommended backup method to use instead of Percona XtraBackup. See [Percona XtraBackup Overview: Compatibility with MariaDB](percona-xtrabackup-overview.md#compatibility-with-mariadb) for more information.



Open source tool for performing hot backups of MariaDB, MySQL and Percona Server databases.
