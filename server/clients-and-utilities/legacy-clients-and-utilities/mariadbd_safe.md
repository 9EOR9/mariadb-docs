# mysqld_safe

From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadbd-safe</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqld_safe</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadbd-safe](../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-safe.md) for details.
