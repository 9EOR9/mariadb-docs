# mysqld_safe

From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadbd-safe`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqld_safe` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadbd-safe](../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-safe.md) for details.
