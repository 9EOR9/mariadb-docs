# mysql_embedded

From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-embedded`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_embedded` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-embedded](../mariadb-embedded.md) for details.
