# mysql\_find\_rows

`mysql_find_rows` reads files containing SQL statements and extracts statements that match a given regular expression or that contain [USE db\_name](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/use-database.md) or [SET](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md) statements.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-find-rows`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_find_rows` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.
