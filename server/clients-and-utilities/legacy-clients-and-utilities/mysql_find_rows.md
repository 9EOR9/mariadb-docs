# mysql_find_rows

`<code>mysql_find_rows</code>` reads files containing SQL statements and extracts statements that match a given regular expression or that contain [USE db_name](../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/beginner-mariadb-articles/useful-mariadb-queries.md) or [SET](../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-cpp/setup-for-connector-cpp-examples.md) statements.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-find-rows</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysql_find_rows</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-find-rows](../mariadb-find-rows.md) for details.
