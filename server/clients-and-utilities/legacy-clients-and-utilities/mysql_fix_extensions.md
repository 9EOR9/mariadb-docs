# mysql_fix_extensions

`mysql_fix_extensions` converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM) table files to their canonical forms.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-fix-extensions`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_fix_extensions` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-fix-extensions](../mariadb-fix-extensions.md) for details.
