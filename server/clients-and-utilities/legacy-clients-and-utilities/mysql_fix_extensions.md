# mysql\_fix\_extensions

`mysql_fix_extensions` converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM) table files to their canonical forms.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-fix-extensions`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_fix_extensions` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-fix-extensions](../table-tools/mariadb-fix-extensions.md) for details.
