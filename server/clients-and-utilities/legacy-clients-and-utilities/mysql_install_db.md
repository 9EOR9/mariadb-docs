# mysql_install_db

`mysql_install_db` initializes the MariaDB data directory and creates the system tables in the mysql database.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-install-db`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_install_db` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-install-db](../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/mariadb-install-db-exe.md) for details.
