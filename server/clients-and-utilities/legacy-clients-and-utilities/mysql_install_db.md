# mysql\_install\_db

`mysql_install_db` initializes the MariaDB data directory and creates the system tables in the mysql database.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-install-db`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_install_db` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-install-db](../deployment-tools/mariadb-install-db.md) for details.
