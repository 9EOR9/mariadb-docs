# mysql_plugin

`mysql_plugin` is a tool for enabling or disabling [plugins](../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/general-development-information/development-plans/old-plans/plugins-storage-engines-summit-for-mysqlmariadbdrizzle-2011.md).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-plugin`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_plugin` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-plugin](../mariadb-plugin.md) for details.
