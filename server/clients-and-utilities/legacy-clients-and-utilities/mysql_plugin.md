# mysql_plugin

`<code>mysql_plugin</code>` is a tool for enabling or disabling [plugins](../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/general-development-information/development-plans/old-plans/plugins-storage-engines-summit-for-mysqlmariadbdrizzle-2011.md).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-plugin</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysql_plugin</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-plugin](../mariadb-plugin.md) for details.
