# mysql\_setpermission

`mariadb-setpermission` is a Perl script that was originally written and contributed by Luuk de Boer to help add users or databases or change passwords in MariaDB.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-setpermission`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_setpermission` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-setpermission](../administrative-tools/mariadb-setpermission.md) for details.
