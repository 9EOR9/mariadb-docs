# mysql\_tzinfo\_to\_sql

`mysql_tzinfo_to_sql` is a utility used to load [time zones](../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md).

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_tzinfo_to_sql` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql](../administrative-tools/mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql.md) for details.
