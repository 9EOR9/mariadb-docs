# mysql_tzinfo_to_sql

`mysql_tzinfo_to_sql` is a utility used to load [time zones](../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_tzinfo_to_sql` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql](../mariadb-tzinfo-to-sql.md) for details.
