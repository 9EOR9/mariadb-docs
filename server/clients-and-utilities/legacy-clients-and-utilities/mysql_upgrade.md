# mysql\_upgrade

`mysql_upgrade` is a tool that checks and updates your tables to the latest version.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-upgrade`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_upgrade` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-upgrade](../deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md) for details.
