# mysql_upgrade

`<code>mysql_upgrade</code>` is a tool that checks and updates your tables to the latest version.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-upgrade</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysql_upgrade</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-upgrade](../mariadb-upgrade.md) for details.
