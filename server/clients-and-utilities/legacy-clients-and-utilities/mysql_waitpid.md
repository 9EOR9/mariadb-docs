# mysql_waitpid

`mysql_waitpid` is a utility for terminating processes. It runs on Unix-like systems, making use of the `kill()` system call.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-waitpid`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysql_waitpid` name via a symlink.

See [mariadb-waitpid](../mariadb-waitpid.md) for details.
