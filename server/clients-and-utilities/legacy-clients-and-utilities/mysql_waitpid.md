# mysql_waitpid

`<code>mysql_waitpid</code>` is a utility for terminating processes. It runs on Unix-like systems, making use of the `<code>kill()</code>` system call.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-waitpid</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysql_waitpid</code>` name via a symlink.



See [mariadb-waitpid](../mariadb-waitpid.md) for details.
