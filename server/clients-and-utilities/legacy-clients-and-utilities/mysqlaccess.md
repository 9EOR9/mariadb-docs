# mysqlaccess

`<code>mysqlaccess</code>` is a tool for checking access privileges, developed by Yves Carlier.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-access</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqlaccess</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-access](../mariadb-access.md) for details.
