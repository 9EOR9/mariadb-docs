# mysqladmin

mysqladmin is an administration program for the mysqld daemon.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-admin`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqladmin` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-admin](../mariadb-admin.md) for details.
