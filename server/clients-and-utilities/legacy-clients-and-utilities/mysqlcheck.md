# mysqlcheck

`<code>mysqlcheck</code>` is a tool for checking, repairing, analyzing and optimizing tables.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-check</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqlcheck</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-check](../mariadb-check.md) for details.
