# mysqlcheck

`mysqlcheck` is a tool for checking, repairing, analyzing and optimizing tables.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-check`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlcheck` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-check](../mariadb-check.md) for details.
