# mysqldumpslow

`mysqldumpslow` is a tool to examine the [slow query log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/).

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-dumpslow`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqldumpslow` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-dumpslow](../logging-tools/mariadb-dumpslow.md) for details.
