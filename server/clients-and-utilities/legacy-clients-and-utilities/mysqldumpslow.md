# mysqldumpslow

`<code>mysqldumpslow</code>` is a tool to examine the [slow query log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/slow-query-log-overview.md).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-dumpslow</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqldumpslow</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.



See [mariadb-dumpslow](../mariadb-dumpslow.md) for details.
