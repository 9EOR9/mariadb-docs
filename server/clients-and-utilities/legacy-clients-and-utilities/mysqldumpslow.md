# mysqldumpslow

`mysqldumpslow` is a tool to examine the [slow query log](../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/slow-query-log-extended-statistics.md).

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-dumpslow`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqldumpslow` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-dumpslow](../mariadb-dumpslow.md) for details.
