# mysqlimport

`mysqlimport` is used to load tables from text files in various formats

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-import`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlimport` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-import](../backup-restore-and-import-clients/mariadb-import.md) for details.
