# mysqlimport

`<code>mysqlimport</code>` is used to load tables from text files in various formats


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-import</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqlimport</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-import](../backup-restore-and-import-clients/mariadb-import.md) for details.
