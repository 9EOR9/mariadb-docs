# mysqlreport

`mysqlreport` makes a friendly report of important MariaDB status values.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-report`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlreport` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-report](../mariadb-report.md) for details.
