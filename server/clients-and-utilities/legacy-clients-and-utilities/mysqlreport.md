# mysqlreport

`<code>mysqlreport</code>` makes a friendly report of important MariaDB status values.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-report</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqlreport</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-report](../mariadb-report.md) for details.
