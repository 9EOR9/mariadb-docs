# mysqlshow

Shows the structure of a MariaDB database (databases, tables, columns and indexes).

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-show`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlshow` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.
