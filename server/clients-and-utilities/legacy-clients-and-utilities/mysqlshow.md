# mysqlshow

Shows the structure of a MariaDB database (databases, tables, columns and indexes).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-show`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlshow` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-show](../mariadb-show.md) for details.
