# mysqlslap

`<code>mysqlslap</code>` is a tool for load-testing MariaDB. It allows you to emulate multiple concurrent connections, and run a set of queries multiple times.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `<code>mariadb-slap</code>`. It can still be accessed under its original `<code>mysqlslap</code>` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-slap](../mariadb-slap.md) for details.
