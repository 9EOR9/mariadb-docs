# mysqlslap

`mysqlslap` is a tool for load-testing MariaDB. It allows you to emulate multiple concurrent connections, and run a set of queries multiple times.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-slap`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlslap` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-slap](../mariadb-slap.md) for details.
