# mariadb-binlog Options

## mariadb-binlog Options

[mariadb-binlog](./) is a utility included with MariaDB for processing [binary log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) and [relay log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/relay-log.md) files.

Prior to [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client was called `mysqlbinlog`. It can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

### Options

The following options are supported by [mariadb-binlog](./). They can be specified on\
the command line or in option files:

| Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | default value      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Introduced |

Options (case-insensitive) include auto, unspec, never and decode-rows. never neither prints base64 encodings nor verbose event data, and will exit on error if a [row-based event](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/binary-log-formats.md) is found. This option is useful for binlogs that are entirely statement based. decode-rows decodes row events into commented SQL statements if the --verbose option is also given. It can enhance the debugging experience with large binary log files, as the raw data will be omitted. Unlike never, mariadb-binlog will not exit with an error if a row event is found. auto (synonymous with unspec) outputs base64 encoded entries for [row-based](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/binary-log-formats.md) and format description events; it should be used when ROW-format events are processed for re-executing on the MariaDB server. This behavior is presumed, such that auto is the default value when no option specification is provided. The other option values are intended only for debugging or testing purposes because they may produce output that does not include all events in executable form. |            |

\| --no-defaults | | Don't read default options from any option file | |\
\| -o value, --offset=value | 0 | Skip the first value entries in the log. | |\
\| --open\_files\_limit=# | 64 | Reserve file descriptors for usage by mariadb-binlog. | |\
\| -p\[passwd], --password\[=passwd] | (No default value) | Password to connect to the remote server. The password can be omitted allow it be entered from the prompt, or an option file can be used to avoid the security risk of passing a password on the commandline. | |\
\| --plugin-dir=dir\_name, | | Directory for client-side plugins. | |\

\| --protocol=name | (No default value) | The protocol of the connection (tcp,socket,pipe,memory). | |\
\| --raw | | Requires -R. Output raw binlog data instead of SQL statements. Output files named after server logs. | |\
\| -R, --read-from-remote-server | FALSE | Read binary logs from a remote MariaDB server rather than reading a local log file. Any connection parameter options are ignored unless this option is given as well. These options are --host, --password, --port, --protocol, --socket, and --user. This option requires that the remote server be running. It works only for binary log files on the remote server, not relay log files. | |\
\| -r name, --result-file=name | (No default value) | Direct output to a given file. With --raw this is a prefix for the file names. | |\
\| --rewrite-db=name | (No default value) | Updates to a database with a different name than the original. Example: rewrite-db='from->to' For events that are binlogged as statements, rewriting the database constitutes changing a statement's default database from db1 to db2. There is no statement analysis or rewrite of any kind, that is, if one specifies "db1.tbl" in the statement explicitly, that occurrence won't be changed to "db2.tbl". Row-based events are rewritten correctly to use the new database name. Filtering (e.g. with --database=name ) happens before the database rewrites have been performed. If you use this option on the command line and ">" has a special meaning to your command interpreter, quote the value (e.g. --rewrite-db="oldname->newname"). | |\
\| --server-id=idnum | 0 | Extract only binlog entries created by the server having the given id.

\| --set-charset=character\_set | (No default value) | Add 'SET NAMES character\_set' to the output to specify the [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) to be used for processing log files. | |\
\| --shared-memory-base-name=name | MYSQL | Shared-memory name to use for Windows connections using shared memory to a local server (started with the --shared-memory option). Case-sensitive. | |\
\| -s, --short-form | FALSE | Just show regular queries: no extra info and no row-based events. This is for testing only, and should not be used in production systems. If you want to suppress base64-output, consider using --base64-output=never instead. | |\
\| --skip-annotate-row-events | | Skip all [Annotate\_rows](annotate_rows_log_event.md) events in the mariadb-binlog output (by default, mariadb-binlog prints Annotate\_rows events, if the binary log does contain them). | |\
\| -S, --socket=name | (No default value) | For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use. | |\
\| --ssl | FALSE | Enables [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). TLS is also enabled even without setting this option when certain other TLS options are set. Starting with [MariaDB 10.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102), the --ssl option will not enable [verifying the server certificate](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#server-certificate-verification) by default. In order to verify the server certificate, the user must specify the --ssl-verify-server-cert option. | |\
\| --ssl-ca=name | | Defines a path to a PEM file that should contain one or more X509 certificates for trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Authorities (CAs)](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-authorities-cas) for more information. This option implies the --ssl option. | |\
\| --ssl-capath=name | | Defines a path to a directory that contains one or more PEM files that should each contain one X509 certificate for a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. The directory specified by this option needs to be run through the [openssl rehash](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/rehash.html) command. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Authorities (CAs)](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-authorities-cas) for more information. This option is only supported if the client was built with OpenSSL or yaSSL. If the client was built with GnuTLS or Schannel, then this option is not supported. See [TLS and Cryptography Libraries Used by MariaDB](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/tls-and-cryptography-libraries-used-by-mariadb.md) for more information about which libraries are used on which platforms. This option implies the --ssl option. | |\
\| --ssl-cert=name | | Defines a path to the X509 certificate file to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. This option implies the --ssl option. | |\
\| --ssl-cipher=name | | List of permitted ciphers or cipher suites to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option implies the --ssl option. | |\
\| --ssl-crl=name | | Defines a path to a PEM file that should contain one or more revoked X509 certificates to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. See [Secure Connections Overview: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#certificate-revocation-lists-crls) for more information. This option is only supported if the client was built with OpenSSL or Schannel. If the client was built with yaSSL or GnuTLS, then this option is not supported. See [TLS and Cryptography Libraries Used by MariaDB](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/tls-and-cryptography-libraries-used-by-mariadb.md) for more information about which libraries are used on which platforms. | |\

\| --ssl-key=name | | Defines a path to a private key file to use for [TLS](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/). This option requires that you use the absolute path, not a relative path. This option implies the --ssl option. | |\
\| --ssl-verify-server-cert | FALSE | Enables [server certificate verification](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#server-certificate-verification). This option is disabled by default. | |\
\| --start-datetime=datetime | (No default value) | Start reading the binlog at first event having a datetime equal to or later than the argument; the argument must be a date and time in the local time zone, in any format accepted by the MariaDB server for [DATETIME](../../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime.md) and [TIMESTAMP](../../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/timestamp.md) types, for example: 2014-12-25 11:25:56 (you should probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly). This option is useful for point-in-time recovery. | |\
\| -j pos, --start-position=pos | 4 | Start reading the binlog at this position. Type can either be a positive integer or, from [MariaDB 10.8.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-8-series/mariadb-10-8-0-release-notes), a [GTID](../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) list. When using a positive integer, the value only applies to the first binlog passed on the command line. In GTID mode, multiple GTIDs can be passed as a comma separated list, where each must have a unique domain id. The list represents the gtid binlog state that the client (another "replica" server) is aware of. Therefore, each GTID is exclusive; only events after a given sequence number will be printed to allow users to receive events after their current state. | |\
\| --stop-datetime=name | (No default value) | Stop reading the binlog at first event having a datetime equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be a date and time in the local time zone, in any format accepted by the MariaDB server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP types, for example: 2014-12-25 11:25:56 (you should probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly). Ignored in --raw mode. | |\
\| --stop-never | | Wait for more data from the server (and thus requires -R or --read-from-remote-server) instead of stopping at the end of the last log. Implies --to-last-log. | |\
\| --stop-never-slave-server-id | | The slave [server\_id](../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) used for --read-from-remote-server --stop-never. | |\
\| --stop-position=pos | 18446744073709551615 | Stop reading the binlog at this position. Type can either be a positive integer or, from [MariaDB 10.8](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-8-series/what-is-mariadb-108), a [GTID](../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) list. When using a positive integer, the value only applies to the last binlog passed on the command line. In GTID mode, multiple GTIDs can be passed as a comma separated list, where each must have a unique domain id. Each GTID is inclusive; only events up to the given sequence numbers are printed. Ignored in --raw mode. | |\
\| -T, --table | | List entries for just this table (affects only row events). | |\
\| --tls-version=name | TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3 | This option accepts a comma-separated list of TLS protocol versions. A TLS protocol version will only be enabled if it is present in this list. All other TLS protocol versions will not be permitted. See [Secure Connections Overview: TLS Protocol Versions](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#tls-protocol-versions) for more information. | [MariaDB 10.4.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/mariadb-1046-release-notes) |\
\| -t, --to-last-log | FALSE | Requires -R or --read-from-remote-server . Will not stop at the end of the requested binlog but rather continue printing until the end of the last binlog of the MariaDB server. If you send the output to the same MariaDB server, that may lead to an endless loop. | |\
\| -u, --user=username | (No default value) | Connect to the remote server as username. | |\
\| -v, --verbose | | Reconstruct SQL statements out of row events. -v -v adds comments on column data types | |\
\| -V, --version | | Print version and exit. | |\
\| --verify-binlog-checksum | | Verify [binlog event checksums](../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/binlog-event-checksums.md) when reading a binlog file. | |

### Option Files

In addition to reading options from the command-line, `mariadb-binlog` can also read options from [option files](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md). If an unknown option is provided to `mariadb-binlog` in an option file, then it is ignored.

The following options relate to how MariaDB command-line tools handles option files. They must be given as the first argument on the command-line:

| Option                    | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Option                    | Description                                                                         |
| --print-defaults          | Print the program argument list and exit.                                           |
| --no-defaults             | Don't read default options from any option file.                                    |
| --defaults-file=#         | Only read default options from the given file #.                                    |
| --defaults-extra-file=#   | Read this file after the global files are read.                                     |
| --defaults-group-suffix=# | In addition to the default option groups, also read option groups with this suffix. |

In [MariaDB 10.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102) and later, `mariadb-binlog` is linked with [MariaDB Connector/C](../../../../kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-c/). However, MariaDB Connector/C does not yet handle the parsing of option files for this client. That is still performed by the server option file parsing code. See [MDEV-19035](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19035) for more information.

#### Option Groups

`mariadb-binlog` reads options from the following [option groups](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md#option-groups) from [option files](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Group             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| \[mysqlbinlog]    | Options read by mariadb-binlog, which includes both MariaDB Server and MySQL Server.                                                                                                                                                       |
| \[mariadb-binlog] | Options read by mariadb-binlog. Available starting with [MariaDB 10.4.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/mariadb-1046-release-notes). |
| \[client]         | Options read by all MariaDB and MySQL [client programs](../../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/), which includes both MariaDB and MySQL clients. For example, mysqldump.                                                                      |
| \[client-server]  | Options read by all MariaDB [client programs](../../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/) and the MariaDB Server. This is useful for options like socket and port, which is common between the server and the clients.                           |
| \[client-mariadb] | Options read by all MariaDB [client programs](../../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/).                                                                                                                                                       |
