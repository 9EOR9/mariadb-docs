# mysqlbinlog

`mysqlbinlog` was a utility included with MariaDB for processing [binary log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/README.md) and [relay log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/relay-log.md) files.


From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-binlog`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqladmin` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-binlog](README.md) for details.
