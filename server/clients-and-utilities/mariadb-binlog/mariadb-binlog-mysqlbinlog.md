# mysqlbinlog

`mysqlbinlog` was a utility included with MariaDB for processing [binary log](../../ref/storage-engines/innodb/binary-log-group-commit-and-innodb-flushing-performance.md) and [relay log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/relay-log.md) files.


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb-binlog`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqladmin` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb-binlog](../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-c/mariadb-binlogreplication-api-reference.md) for details.
