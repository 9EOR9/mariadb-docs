# mysql Command-Line Client

{% hint style="info" %}
The client is now called [`mariadb`](mariadb-command-line-client.md). The old name, `mysql`, can still be used, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.
{% endhint %}

`mysql` is a simple SQL shell with GNU readline capabilities.
