# mysql Command-line Client

mysql is a simple SQL shell (with GNU readline capabilities).


From [MariaDB 10.5](../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md), the client is called `mariadb`. The old name, `mysql`, can still be used, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.


See [mariadb](mariadb-command-line-client.md) for details.
