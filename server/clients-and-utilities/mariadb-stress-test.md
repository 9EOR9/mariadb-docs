# mariadb-stress-test

`mariadb-stress-test` is a symlink to `mysql-stress-test`, the script for assisting with adding users or databases or changing passwords in MariaDB.

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.5.2**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)

From [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), `mysql-stress-test` is the symlink, and `mariadb-stress-test` the binary name.

_mariadb-stress-test.pl_ is a Perl script that performs stress-testing of the MariaDB server. It requires a version of Perl that has been built with threads support.
