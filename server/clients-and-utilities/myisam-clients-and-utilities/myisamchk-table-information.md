# myisamchk Table Information

[myisamchk](myisamchk.md) can be used to obtain information about MyISAM tables, particularly with the _-d_, _-e_, _-i_ and _-v_ options.

Common options for gathering information include:

* myisamchk -d
* myisamchk -dv
* myisamchk -dvv
* myisamchk -ei
* myisamchk -eiv

The _-d_ option returns a short description of the table and its keys. Running the option while the table is being updated, and with external locking disabled, may result in an error, but no damage is done to the table. Each extra _v_ adds more output. _-e_ checks the table thoroughly (but slowly), and the _-i_ options adds statistical information,

## -dvv output

The following table describes the output from the running myisamchk with the _-dvv_ option:
