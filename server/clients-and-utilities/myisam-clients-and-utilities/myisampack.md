# myisampack

## myisampack

`myisampack` is a tool for compressing [MyISAM](../../reference/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables. The resulting tables\
are read-only, and usually about 40% to 70% smaller. It is run as follows:

```
myisampack [options] file_name [file_name2...]
```

The `file_name` is the `.MYI` index file. The extension can be omitted,\
although keeping it permits wildcards, such as:

```
myisampack *.MYI
```

...to compress all the files.

`myisampack` compresses each column separately, and, when the resulting data\
is read, only the individual rows and columns required need to be decompressed,\
allowing for quicker reading.

Once a table has been packed, use `[myisamchk -rq](myisamchk.md)` (the quick\
and recover options) to rebuild its indexes.

`myisampack` does not support partitioned tables.

Do not run myisampack if the tables could be updated during the operation, and[skip\_external\_locking](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#skip_external_locking) has\
been set.

### Options

The following variables can be set while passed as commandline options to`myisampack`, or set with a `[myisampack]` section in your[my.cnf](../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md) file.

| Option                    | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Option                    | Description                                    |
| -b, --backup              | Make a backup of the table as table\_name.OLD. |
| --character-sets-dir=name | Directory where character sets are.            |
| -                         |                                                |

## , --debug\[=name] | Output debug log. Often this is 'd:t:o,filename'. |

\| -f, --force | Force packing of table even if it gets bigger or if tempfile exists. |\
\| -j, --join=name | Join all given tables into 'new\_table\_name'. All tables must have identical layouts. |\
\| -?, --help | Display help and exit. |\
\| -s, --silent | Only write output when an error occurs |\
\| -T, --tmpdir=name | Use temporary directory to store temporary table. |\
\| -t, --test | Don't pack table, only test packing it. |\
\| -v, --verbose | Write info about progress and packing result. Use multiple -v flags for more verbosity. |\
\| -V, --version | Output version information and exit. |\
\| -w, --wait | Wait and retry if table is in use. |

### Uncompressing

To uncompress a table compressed with `myisampack`, use the`[myisamchk -u](myisamchk.md)` option.

### Examples

```
> myisampack /var/lib/mysql/test/posts
Compressing /var/lib/mysql/test/posts.MYD: (1680 records)
- Calculating statistics
- Compressing file
37.71%
> myisamchk -rq /var/lib/mysql/test/posts
- check record delete-chain
- recovering (with sort) MyISAM-table '/var/lib/mysql/test/posts'
Data records: 1680
- Fixing index 1
- Fixing index 2
```
