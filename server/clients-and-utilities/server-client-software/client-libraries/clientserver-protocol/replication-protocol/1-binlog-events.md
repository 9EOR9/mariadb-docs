# 1-Binlog Events

Binary log events, or binlog events, are information about data modification made to a MariaDB server instance stored in the [binary log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) files.

### Log File Structure

Each log file contains:

* a 4-byte magic number, followed by a series of events describing data modifications:\
  The magic number bytes are 0xfe 0x62 0x69 0x6e = 0xfe 'b''i''n' (this is the BINLOG\_MAGIC constant).
* series of binlog events.

### Event Content

Each event contains the 'header' followed by 'data bytes':

The header bytes provide information about

* event type
* creation time
* which server created the event
* flags and so forth

The data bytes provide information specific to the type of event.

Note that the first event, [FORMAT\_DESCRIPTION\_EVENT](format_description_event.md) at 'position' 4, is a descriptor event that describes the format used to write events in the file.

The remaining events are interpreted according to the version.

The final event is usually a log-rotation event [ROTATE\_EVENT](rotate_event.md) that specifies the next binary log filename or a [STOP\_EVENT](stop_event.md) written during server shutdown.

**Note**: in case of a server crash there is no terminating event (no ROTATE nor STOP)
