# 4-Semi-Sync Replication

[Regular MariaDB replication](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/) is asynchronous.\
MariaDB, since [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference), has included [semisynchronous replication](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/semisynchronous-replication.md) semi-synchronous Binlog Event.

### Event Header Changes

If the user variable `@rpl_semi_sync_slave` is set, 2 exta bytes are added after the status byte of a [binlog network stream](3-binlog-network-stream.md) and before the normal binlog event header.

* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) semi-sync indicator, always 0xef
* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) semi-sync flags, either 0x00 (no ACK) or 0x01 (ACK)

**Note** : The packet size, as in the network protocol header, is then: `event_size + 1 byte status + 2 bytes semi-sync replication`.

The MariaDB server sets the user variable whenever it is starting replication. For MariaDB Connector/C , the following query must be executed before the call to `mariadb_rpl_open()` is made to enable semi-sync replication.

```
SET @rpl_semi_sync_slave=1
```

If the semi-sync flag is set to 0x01, the master waits for a Semi Sync ACK packet from the slave and when the Semi Sync ACK is seen, the master acknowledges the client which has issued the transaction with a standard OK\_Packet or a ERR\_Packet.

The master can then write the transaction to the binary log and send the next events to the slave.

**Note** : The master only requests Semi Sync ACKs if [rpl\_semi\_sync\_master\_enabled](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/semisynchronous-replication.md#rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled) is enabled. If it is not enabled, the semi-sync flag will always be 0x00.

#### Semi Sync ACK Details

This event is sent by the slave **only if** the semi-sync flag is set to 0x01.

* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) semi-sync indicator, always 0xef
* [uint<8>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) the next position of received event
* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) binlog file name.

**Note**: this packet sent by the slave never includes the CRC32.

Sending an ACK when the semi-sync flag is set to 0x0 will cause an error and the connection is closed.

#### Example of Heartbeat Event With Semi-Sync Protocol and CRC32

We can clearly see:

* 2a 00 00 \[3 bytes] packet size:
* 06 \[1] sequence
* 00 \[1] status byte = 00 => OK
* ef 00 \[2] bytes => semi sync indicator (0xef) and semi-sync flag (00)

the ef 00 2 bytes after the OK byte 00

```
T 127.0.0.1:23240 -> 127.0.0.1:41054 [AP]

```

#### Example of XID\_EVENT, With CRC32

The master sets the Semi-Sync ACK request in the XID\_EVENT event:

We see the 2 semi sync bytes: **ef** and **01**.\
The latter, being 1, means the slave server must send the Semi Sync ACK packet.

We also see in the binlog event header:

* Event Type \[1] = 10 XID\_EVENT
* Next Event pos \[4] = 4a 05 00 00 => 1354

```
22 00 00 0c 00 ef 01 17  d0 37 5a 17 d0 37 5a 10  "............7Z.

00 00 00 00 00 00 44 30  aa fc                    ......D0..
```

#### Example of Semi-Sync ACK

This is sent by the slave server after the XID\_EVENT receiving.

We see:

* the semi sync indicator \[1] = 0xef, sent before anything else
* the Next Event position \[8] = 4a 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 => 1354\
  which is the next position of the XID\_EVENT above
* the binlog filename = mysql-bin.000034

Please note:

* there is no terminating CRC32
* the packet sequence now start starts from 0
