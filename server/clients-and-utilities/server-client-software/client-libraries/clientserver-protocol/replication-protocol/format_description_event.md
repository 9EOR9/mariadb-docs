# FORMAT_DESCRIPTION_EVENT

This is a descriptor event that is written to the beginning of a [binary log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/README.md) file, at position 4 (after the 4 magic number bytes)


The whole event written to disk is [byte<19>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) event header + data fields


#### Header


* The Event Type is 15 (0x0f)


#### Fields



* [uint<2>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) The binary log format version. This is 4 in MariaDB 10 and up.
* [string<50>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) The MariaDB server version (example: 10.2.1-debug-log), padded with 0x00 bytes on the right.
* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) Timestamp in seconds when this event was created (this is the moment when the binary log was created). This value is redundant; the same value occurs in the timestamp header field.
* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) The header length. This length - 19 gives the size of the extra headers field at the end of the header for other events.
* [byte<n>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) Variable-sized. An array that indicates the post-header lengths for all event types.
There is one byte per event type that the server knows about.
The value 'n' comes from the following formula:


```
n = event_size - header length - offset (2 + 50 + 4 + 1) - checksum_algo - checksum
```


* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) Checksum Algorithm Type
* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) CRC32 4 bytes (value matters only if checksum algo is CRC32)
