# GTID\_LIST\_EVENT

Logged in every binlog to record the current [replication](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/) state. Consists of the last [GTID](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) seen for each replication domain.

The Global Transaction ID, [GTID](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid.md) for short, consists of three components:

* replication domain ID
* master server ID
* sequence ID

It's represented as three numbers separated with dashes '-'\
For example:`1-1222-1011`

It's usually written after the [Format Description Event](format_description_event.md), if binary log encryption is enabled it is written after the [Start Encryption Event](start_encryption_event.md).

**Note**: In case of encrypted binlog files ([encrypt\_binlog](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) is set to ON), this event is written just after the [START\_ENCRYPTION\_EVENT](start_encryption_event.md)

#### Header

* Event type is 163 (0xa3)

#### Fields

* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) Number of GTIDs
* for (i=0; i < gtid\_count; i++)
  * [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) Replication Domain ID
  * [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) Server\_ID
  * [uint<8>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) GTID sequence

The minimum content size for 1 GTID is:\
4 + (4 + 4 + 8) \* 1 = 20 bytes

### Example With 1 GTID, With CRC32

From the [mysqlbinlog](../../../../mariadb-binlog/) utility:

170824 9:52:04 server id 10124 end\_log\_pos 292 CRC32 **0xb6d8f0a8** Gtid list **\[0-10124-3584]**

```

```

#### Header, 19 Bytes

* Event Time = a4 85 9e 59 ===> 2017-08-24 9:52:04
* Event Type = a3 => 163
* Server\_id = 8c 27 00 00 => 00 00 27 8c => 10124
* Event Size = 2b => 43 (header\[19] + 1 GTID(20 bytes) + CRC32\[4]
* Next Pos = 24 01 00 00 => 00 00 01 24 => 292
* Flags = 00 => 0

#### Content, Variable Size, is (4 + (4 + 4 + 8 ) \* n\_GTIDs) Bytes

The content example with one GTID is 20 bytes + 4 bytes CRC32:

* Number of GTIDs\[4] = 01 00 00 00 => 1
* GTID\[0] replication\_domain\[4] = 00 00 00 00 => 0
* GTID\[0] Server\_id\[4] = 8c 27 00 00 => 00 00 27 8c => 10124
* GTID\[0] Sequence\[8] = 00 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 ===> 3584
* crc32\[4] = a8 f0 d8 b6 => b6 d8 f0 a8 => 0xb6d8f0a8
