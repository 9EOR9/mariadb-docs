# HEARTBEAT\_LOG\_EVENT

This event does not appear in the [binary log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/).\
It's only sent over the network by a master to a slave server to let it know that the master is still alive, and is only sent when the master has no binlog events to send to slave servers.

{% hint style="info" %}
This event is never written into the binary log file
{% endhint %}
