# START\_ENCRYPTION\_EVENT

The `START_ENCRYPTION` event is written to every [binary log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) file if [encrypt\_binlog](../../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) is set to ON.

This event is written just once, after the Format Description event (which is the first event of a binlog file at pos 4).

The event has the 19 bytes event header with EventType set to value 164 (0xa4) + 17 bytes data.

#### Header

* Event type is 164 (0xa4)

#### Fields

* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) The Encryption scheme, always set to 1 for system files.
* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) The Encryption key version.
* [byte<12>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) Nonce (12 random bytes) of current binlog file.

#### Decryption of following events

All data of following events in the binlog file are encrypted, except for the event\_length field

The 16 byte encryption IV is generated from the 12 byte nonce ([uint<12>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers)) in the binlog plus the current position\
of the event being encrypted ([uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers)). This means the last four bytes of the IV change for every event and the first 12 bytes change for every binlog file.

Since the event\_length is always unencrypted, the encrypted data block has to be modified before it can be decrypted:

* store event\_length
* copy the first four bytes (encrypted timestamp) to event\_length position (offset=9)
* decrypt starting from offset 4 and store result at offset 4 of decrypted buffer

The unencrypted block now also needs to be modified

* move unencrypted timestamp value from offset 9 to the beginning (offset=0)
* store event\_length at position 9
