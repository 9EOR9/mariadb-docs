# Enterprise Server Lifecycle

[MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/products/mariadb-enterprise-server/) enables a predictable development and operations experience through an _enterprise lifecycle_. This enterprise lifecycle incorporates optimized builds, predictable release behavior, and vendor support.

### Enterprise Server Builds

MariaDB Enterprise Server incorporates enhancements that are not present in MariaDB Community Server including:

* Premium features to meet enterprise scaling and operations requirements.
* Priority bug fixes that are available first to enterprise customers.
* Increased code stability through restricted release of new functionality.
* Reduction of risk from untested or incompatible features, through inclusion of only features with level 3 support (Engineering code-level support) from MariaDB Corporation.
* Optimized configuration defaults.

For details on features added to enhance, harden, and secure MariaDB Enterprise Server, see [What's New in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6?](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/whats-new/mariadb-enterprise-server-11-4/).

### Enterprise Server Releases

Releases of MariaDB Enterprise Server are predictable because:

* Major releases are delivered on a schedule.
* Minor releases are focused on small, incremental defect remediation.
* Critical fixes from newer release series are selectively backported.
* Enterprise-grade testing drives a low defect rate.
* Specific changes present in each release are clearly communicated.

* The point release of MariaDB Community Server used as the base of this Enterprise Server release (.8, spoken "ten-five-eight").
