# General Thread States

This article documents the major general thread states. More specific lists related to [delayed inserts](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert-delayed.md), replication, the [query cache](../query-cache.md) and the [event scheduler](../../../../server-usage/triggers-events/event-scheduler/events.md) are listed in:

* [Event Scheduler Thread States](event-scheduler-thread-states.md)
* [Query Cache Thread States](query-cache-thread-states.md)
* [Master Thread States](master-thread-states.md)
* [Slave Connection Thread States](slave-connection-thread-states.md)
* [Slave I/O Thread States](replica-io-thread-states.md)
* [Slave SQL Thread States](slave-sql-thread-states.md)

These correspond to the `STATE` values listed by the [SHOW PROCESSLIST](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-processlist.md) statement or in the [Information Schema PROCESSLIST Table](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-processlist-table.md) as well as the `PROCESSLIST_STATE` value listed in the [Performance Schema threads Table](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-threads-table.md)

| System lock                     | Requesting or waiting for an external lock for a specific table. The [storage engine](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/) determines what kind of external lock to use. For example, the [MyISAM](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) storage engine uses file-based locks. However, MyISAM's external locks are disabled by default, due to the default value of the [skip\_external\_locking](../../system-variables/server-system-variables.md#skip_external_locking) system variable. Transactional storage engines such as [InnoDB](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) also register the transaction or statement with MariaDB's [transaction coordinator](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/transaction-coordinator-log/) while in this thread state. See [MDEV-19391](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19391) for more information about that. |
