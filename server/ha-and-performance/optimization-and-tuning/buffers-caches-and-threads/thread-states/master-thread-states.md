# Master Thread States

This article documents thread states that are related to [replication](broken-reference) master threads. These correspond to the `STATE` values listed by the [SHOW PROCESSLIST](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-processlist.md) statement or in the [Information Schema PROCESSLIST Table](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-processlist-table.md) as well as the `PROCESSLIST_STATE` value listed in the [Performance Schema threads Table](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-threads-table.md).
