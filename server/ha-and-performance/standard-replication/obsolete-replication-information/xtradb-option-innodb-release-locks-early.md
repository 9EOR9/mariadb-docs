# XtraDB option --innodb-release-locks-early

The --innodb-release-locks-early feature ([MWL#163](https://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=163)) was included in the [5.2\
replication preview](mariadb-52-replication-feature-preview.md). However, it was omitted from [MariaDB 5.3](broken-reference) due to the bug[lp:798213](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maria/+bug/798213).
