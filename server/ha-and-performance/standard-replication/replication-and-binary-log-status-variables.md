# Replication and Binary Log Status Variables

The terms _master_ and _slave_ have historically been used in replication, and MariaDB has begun the process of adding _primary_ and _replica_ synonyms. The old terms will continue to be used to maintain backward compatibility - see [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777) to follow progress on this effort.

The following status variables are useful in [binary logging](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) and [replication](broken-reference). See [Server Status Variables](../optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md) for a complete list of status variables that can be viewed with [SHOW STATUS](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status.md).

See also the [Full list of MariaDB options, system and status variables](../../server-management/variables-and-modes/full-list-of-mariadb-options-system-and-status-variables.md).

#### `Binlog_bytes_written`

* Data Type: `numeric`

#### `Binlog_cache_disk_use`

* Description: Number of transactions which used a temporary disk cache because they could not fit in the regular [binary log](../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) cache, being larger than [binlog\_cache\_size](../optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#binlog_cache_size).

The global value can be flushed by `[FLUSH STATUS](../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md)`.

#### `Binlog_group_commit_trigger_lock_wait`
