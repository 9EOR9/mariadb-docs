# Troubleshooting Connection Issues Guide

The guide helps diagnose and resolve common issues encountered when connecting to a MariaDB server. Identify causes for errors like 'Can't connect to local server' or access denied messages, and learn steps to effectively troubleshoot these connection problems.

If you are completely new to MariaDB and relational databases, you may want to start with [A MariaDB Primer](../server-usage/basics/mariadb-usage-guide-1.md). Also, ensure you understand the connection parameters discussed in the [Connection Parameters Guide](mariadb-connecting-guide.md).

### Server Not Running or Incorrect Location

Symptoms:

You receive errors similar to:

```sql
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through
  socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2 "No such file or directory")
```

or

```sql
mariadb -u someuser -p --port=3307 --protocol=tcp
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost'
  (111 "Connection refused")
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

* **Server Not Running:** The MariaDB server process may not be running.
* **Incorrect Parameters:** The server is running, but not on the specified host, port, socket, pipe, or protocol. Verify your connection parameters.
* **Socket File Mismatch (Unix):** The socket file path might be non-standard or inconsistent between server and client configurations.
  * Check your `my.cnf` (or `my.ini`) configuration file. Ensure the `socket` option has the identical value in both the `[mysqld]` (server) section and the `[client]` (or `[mysql]`) section.
  *   To find the running Unix socket file, you can try commands like:

      ```bash
      netstat -ln | grep mysqld
      ```

      Example output:

      ```bash
      unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     33209505 /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
      ```
* See also: [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/troubleshooting-installation-issues/).

### Unable to Connect from a Remote Location

Symptoms:

You can connect locally, but not from a remote machine, possibly seeing errors like:

```bash
./client/mysql --host=myhost --protocol=tcp --port=3306 test
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'myhost' (115)
```

You can use `telnet` (if available) to test basic network connectivity to the port:

```bash
telnet myhost 3306
```

A "Connection refused" message from telnet indicates a network or firewall issue, or that MariaDB is not listening for TCP/IP connections or on that specific interface/port.

The perror utility can interpret OS error codes:

```bash
perror 115
```

Example output:

```bash
OS error code 115: Operation now in progress
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

* By default, MariaDB often does not accept remote TCP/IP connections or is bound only to `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`).
* **Solution:** See [Configuring MariaDB for Remote Client Access](../server-usage/connecting/mariadb-remote-connection-guide-1.md) for detailed instructions on how to enable remote connections by adjusting the `bind-address` server variable and ensuring user accounts are configured correctly for remote hosts.

### Authentication Problems

Symptoms:

Connection is established, but authentication fails (e.g., "Access denied for user...").

**Causes & Solutions:**

* **Unix Socket Authentication (MariaDB 10.4.3+):** On Unix-like systems, the `unix_socket` authentication plugin is enabled by default for local connections via the Unix socket file. This plugin uses operating system user credentials.
  * See the [`unix_socket` authentication plugin documentation](../reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-plugin-unix-socket.md) for connection instructions and how to switch to password-based authentication if needed.
  * For an overview of authentication changes in MariaDB 10.4, see [Authentication from MariaDB 10.4](../security/user-account-management/authentication-from-mariadb-10-4.md).
* **Incorrect Username/Host Combination:** Authentication is specific to a `username@host` combination. For example, `'user1'@'localhost'` is distinct from `'user1'@'166.78.144.191'`. Ensure the user account exists for the host from which you are connecting.
  * See the [GRANT](../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) article for details on granting permissions.
* **Password Hashing:** When setting or changing passwords using `SET PASSWORD`, ensure the `PASSWORD()` function is used if the server expects hashed passwords.
  * Example: `SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.loc.gov' = PASSWORD('newpass');`
  * Rather than: `SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.loc.gov' = 'newpass';` (which might store the password as plain text, potentially leading to issues depending on the authentication plugin).

### Problems Exporting Query Results or Loading Data

Symptoms:

You can run regular queries but get authentication or permission errors when using SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE, SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE, or LOAD DATA INFILE.

**Causes & Solutions:**

* These operations require the `FILE` privilege on the server.
* **Solution:** Grant the necessary `FILE` privilege to the user. See the [GRANT](../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) article.

### Access Denied to a Specific Database

Symptoms:

You can connect to the MariaDB server, but attempting to USE or query a specific database results in an error:

```sql
USE test;
ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'youruser'@'yourhost' to database 'test'
```

Or, connecting with `mariadb -u user -p db1` works, but `mariadb -u user -p db2` fails for `db2`.

**Causes & Solutions:**

* The user account has not been granted sufficient privileges for that particular database.
* **Solution:** Grant the required privileges (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc.) on the specific database to the user. See the GRANT article.

### Issues Due to Option Files or Environment Variables

Symptoms:

Unexpected connection behavior or parameter usage that you didn't explicitly provide on the command line.

**Causes & Solutions:**

* Option files (e.g., `my.cnf`, `.my.cnf`) or environment variables (e.g., `MYSQL_HOST`) might be supplying incorrect or overriding connection parameters.
* **Troubleshooting:**
  * Check the values in any option files read by your client. See [Configuring MariaDB with Option Files](../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md) and the documentation for the specific client you are using (listed under [Clients and Utilities](../clients-and-utilities/)).
  *   You can often suppress the reading of default option files by using a `--no-defaults` option (if supported by the client):Bash

      ```bash
      mariadb-import --no-defaults ...
      ```

### Unable to Connect / Lost Root Password

Symptoms:

You cannot connect to a running server, often because the root (or other administrative) password is lost or unknown.

**Causes & Solutions:**

* **Solution:** You can start the MariaDB server with the `--skip-grant-tables` option. This bypasses the privilege system, granting full access. **Use this with extreme caution and only temporarily.**
  1. Stop the MariaDB server.
  2. Restart the server manually from the command line, adding the `--skip-grant-tables` option.
  3. Connect to the server (no password will be required for `root@localhost`).
  4. Execute `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` to reload the grant tables (they are now active again).
  5.  Change the password for the necessary account, e.g.:

      ```sql
      SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('your_new_strong_password');
      ```
  6. Stop the server and restart it normally (without `--skip-grant-tables`).

### `localhost` vs. `%` Wildcard Host Issues

Symptoms:

You've created a user like 'melisa'@'%' but cannot log in as melisa when connecting from localhost.

```sql
-- User created with '%' host
CREATE USER 'melisa'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

-- Checking users in mysql.user table
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user WHERE user='melisa' OR user='';
```

Example output showing the problem:

```sql
+--------+-----------+
| user   | host      |
+--------+-----------+
| melisa | %         |
|        | localhost | -- An anonymous user for localhost
+--------+-----------+
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

* MariaDB's user authentication prioritizes more specific host matches. If an anonymous user (`''@'localhost'`) exists, it can take precedence over `'melisa'@'%'` when connecting from `localhost`.
* **Solutions:**
  1.  **Create a specific user for localhost:**&#x53;QL

      ```sql
      CREATE USER 'melisa'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password_for_melisa_localhost';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yourdatabase.* TO 'melisa'@'localhost'; -- Grant necessary privileges
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```
  2.  **Remove the anonymous user for localhost (use with caution):**&#x53;QL

      ```sql
      DROP USER ''@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```

      Ensure this doesn't break other intended anonymous access if any.
