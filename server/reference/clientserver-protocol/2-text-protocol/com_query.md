# COM\_QUERY

With the `COM_QUERY` command, the client sends the server an SQL statement to be executed immediately.

## Fields

* [int<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) 0x03 : COM\_QUERY header.
* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#end-of-file-length-strings) SQL statement.

The SQL statement should be properly escaped. The escape character is usually a backslash '' = `0x5c`. However, if the status flag returned by the last [OK Packet](../4-server-response-packets/ok_packet.md#status-flag) had the `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` bit set, the escape character is a single quote (`'` = `0x60`).

If the escape character is a backslash, the following characters are escaped:

* Single quote (`'` = `0x60`).
* Backslash (`\` = `0x5c`).
* Double quote (`"` = `0x22`).
* Null character (`0x00`).

If the escape character is a single quote, only the single quote (`'` = `0x60`) can be escaped.

## Response

The server can answer with 4 different responses that can be differentiated by the first byte (packet header):

* `0xFF` - [ERR\_Packet](../4-server-response-packets/err_packet.md) if any error occurs.
* `0x00` - [OK\_Packet](../4-server-response-packets/ok_packet.md) when query execution works without result set.
* `0xFB` - [LOCAL\_INFILE Packet](../4-server-response-packets/packet_local_infile.md) if the query was `LOCAL INFILE ...`.
* Or a [result set](../4-server-response-packets/result-set-packets.md), when the query returns results (in case of a `SELECT` query, for example).
