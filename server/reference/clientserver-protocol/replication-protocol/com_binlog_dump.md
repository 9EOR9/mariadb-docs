# COM\_BINLOG\_DUMP

This is a command the replica sends to the master after [COM\_REGISTER\_SLAVE](com_register_slave.md).

The master server sends the [binlog events](1-binlog-events.md) from the requested file and position, or if GTID registration is in use, from the GTID value set in the earlier registration phase.

The payload is:

* [uint<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) command (COM\_BINLOG\_DUMP = 0x12).
* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) The requested binlog position.
* [uint<2>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) Flags.
* [uint<4>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) Slave server\_id.
* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes) The requested binlog file name.

## **Note**

* Flags, usually set to `0`. It can be set to `BINLOG_SEND_ANNOTATE_ROWS_EVENT` (`0x02`) if the replica server wants to receive the MariaDB 10 [ANNOTATE\_ROWS](annotate_rows_event.md) events.\
  It can also be set to `BINLOG_DUMP_NON_BLOCK` (`1`), in the case the replica is receiving an EOF packet after the last event sent by the master.
* Requested binlog position can be `4` when registering to master server for the very first time\
  or when requesting events from a particular binlog file from the beginning of it.
* The requested binlog file can empty when registering for the very first time if master log file is unknown or with GTID registration (not required).
* After sending events to the replica the server kills the connection.

When replication resumes or it is restarted (`STOP REPLICA`; `START REPLICA`), the replica server always\
sends the latest binlog file name and position, even if GTID registration is in place.

## Example of COM\_BINLOG\_DUMP

```
1b 00 00 00 12 34 06 00    00 02 00 75 27 00 00 6d    .....4.....u'..m
  79 73 71 6c 2d 62 69 6e    2e 30 30 30 30 33 34       ysql-bin.000034
```

After 4 bytes network protocol header we can see:

* Command \[1] = 12.
* Requested binlog position \[4] = 34 06 00 00 => 00 00 06 34 = 1588.
* Flags \[2] = 02 00 => 2 = `BINLOG_SEND_ANNOTATE_ROWS_EVENT`.
* Binlog file\[n] = mysql-bin.000034.
