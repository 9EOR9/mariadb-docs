# STOP\_EVENT

The master server writes the event to the [binary log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) when it shuts down, or when resuming after a mariadbd process crash.

A new binary log file is always created, but there is no `ROTATE_EVENT`.

`STOP_EVENT` is the last written event after a clean shutdown, or when resuming after a crash.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This event is never sent to replica servers.
{% endhint %}

## Header

* Event header with EventType set to `STOP_EVENT` (`0x03`).
* Event header NextPos set to `EOF` .
* No special flags added.

## Fields

## Example With CRC32 (Last 4 Bytes)
