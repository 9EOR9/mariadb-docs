# DOUBLE

## Syntax


```
DOUBLE[(M,D)] [SIGNED | UNSIGNED | ZEROFILL]
DOUBLE PRECISION[(M,D)] [SIGNED | UNSIGNED | ZEROFILL]
REAL[(M,D)] [SIGNED | UNSIGNED | ZEROFILL]
```


## Description


A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number (see [FLOAT](float.md) for a single-precision floating-point number).


Allowable values are:


* `-1.7976931348623157E+308` to `-2.2250738585072014E-308`
* `0`
* `2.2250738585072014E-308` to `1.7976931348623157E+308`


These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. The actual range
might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware or operating system.


`M` is the total number of digits and `D` is the number of digits
following the decimal point. If `M` and `D` are omitted, values are stored
to the limits allowed by the hardware. A double-precision
floating-point number is accurate to approximately 15 decimal places.


`UNSIGNED`, if specified, disallows negative values.


`ZEROFILL`, if specified, pads the number with zeros, up to the total number
of digits specified by `M`.


REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION are synonyms, unless the REAL_AS_FLOAT [SQL mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) is enabled, in which case REAL is a synonym for [FLOAT](float.md) rather than DOUBLE.


See [Floating Point Accuracy](floating-point-accuracy.md) for issues when using floating-point numbers.

## Examples


```
CREATE TABLE t1 (d DOUBLE(5,0) zerofill);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4);

SELECT * FROM t1;
+-------+
| d     |
+-------+
| 00001 |
| 00002 |
| 00003 |
| 00004 |
