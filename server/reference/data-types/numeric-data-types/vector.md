# VECTOR

{% hint style="info" %}
`VECTOR` is available from MariaDB 11.7.1.
{% endhint %}

## Syntax

```sql
VECTOR(N)
```

## Description

The `VECTOR` data type was added as part of the [vectors](../../sql-structure/vectors/) feature, which permits MariaDB Server to perform as a relational vector database. `N` represents the fixed number of dimensions of the vector up to a maximum of 65532. The `N` dimension will be determined by the embedding algorithm.

## Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, v VECTOR(5) NOT NULL,
 VECTOR INDEX (v));
```
