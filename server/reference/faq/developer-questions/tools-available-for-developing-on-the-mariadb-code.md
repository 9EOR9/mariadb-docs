# Tools Available for Developing on the MariaDB Code

The code is hosted on [server](https://github.com/MariaDB/server). You can
branch the latest code from there, and you can also push your own changes as a
new branch that can be shared with others.


[Building the code from source](../../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/compiling-mariadb-from-source/README.md) is done with standard Unix tools: CMake (or autotools for MariaDB versions below 5.5), Gnu Make, GCC (or other C/C++ compiler on some systems). On
[Windows](../../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/compiling-mariadb-from-source/Building_MariaDB_on_Windows.md), CMake and Visual Studio are used.


The current state of the source with respect to build/test failures can be seen
in [buildbot](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/buildbot/).


For project management and bug tracking, we use [JIRA](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/jira).


The [source](../../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/compiling-mariadb-from-source/README.md) page has links to instructions on setting up a full development environment, if you are interested.
