# Getting Help With MariaDB

If you can't find help in the [MariaDB documentation](/kb/en/mariadb-documentation/), you can also subscribe to the [mailing lists](../../../../general-resources/company-and-community/friends-of-mariadb/resources.md) or [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com) to communicate with MariaDB users and developers.


There's an active help community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming with SQL and indexing questions, and [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/) for non-programming questions for example tuning/backups/architecture/migration/replication etc. Use the *mariadb* tag so questions are searchable by those that can help you.


If you have a question about a feature that is not properly documented or something that is not working as expected, go to the corresponding [Knowledge Base page](../../../../columnstore/using-mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-with-spark.md) and ask your question there.


You can report and check on bugs which apply to MariaDB in [JIRA](../../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/jira.md).


[MariaDB plc](https://mariadb.com) offers [commercial support](https://mariadb.com/services/mariadb-mysql-subscription-services).
