# Getting Help With MariaDB

If you can't find help in the [MariaDB documentation](/kb/en/mariadb-documentation/), you can also subscribe to the [mailing lists](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/company-and-community/friends-of-mariadb/resources) or [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com) to communicate with MariaDB users and developers.


There's an active help community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming with SQL and indexing questions, and [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/) for non-programming questions for example tuning/backups/architecture/migration/replication etc. Use the *mariadb* tag so questions are searchable by those that can help you.


If you have a question about a feature that is not properly documented or something that is not working as expected, go to the corresponding [Knowledge Base page](/kb/en/mariadb/) and ask your question there.


You can report and check on bugs which apply to MariaDB in [JIRA](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/tools/jira).
