# Encryption Plugin API

MariaDB's [data-at-rest encryption](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/data-at-rest-encryption-overview.md) requires the use of a [key management and encryption plugin](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/encryption-key-management.md). These plugins are responsible both for the management of encryption keys and for the actual encryption and decryption of data.

MariaDB supports the use of [multiple encryption keys](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/encryption-key-management.md#using-multiple-encryption-keys). Each encryption key uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier. If the specific plugin supports [key rotation](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/encryption-key-management.md#rotating-keys), then encryption keys can also be rotated, which creates a new version of the encryption key.

See [Data at Rest Encryption](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/data-at-rest-encryption-overview.md) and [Encryption Key Management](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/encryption-key-management.md) for more information.

## Encryption Plugin API

The Encryption plugin API was created to allow a plugin to:

* implement key management, provide encryption keys to the server on request and change them according to internal policies.
* implement actual data encryption and decryption with the algorithm defined by the plugin.

This is how the API reflects that:

```
/* Returned from get_latest_key_version() */
#define ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION_INVALID (~(unsigned int)0)
#define ENCRYPTION_KEY_NOT_ENCRYPTED (0)

#define ENCRYPTION_KEY_SYSTEM_DATA 1
#define ENCRYPTION_KEY_TEMPORARY_DATA 2

/* Returned from get_key()  */
#define ENCRYPTION_KEY_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL (100)

#define ENCRYPTION_FLAG_DECRYPT 0
#define ENCRYPTION_FLAG_ENCRYPT 1
#define ENCRYPTION_FLAG_NOPAD 2

struct st_mariadb_encryption {
  int interface_version; /**< version plugin uses */

  /********************* KEY MANAGEMENT ***********************************/

  /**
    Function returning latest key version for a given key id.

    @return A version or ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION_INVALID to indicate an error.
  */
  unsigned int (*get_latest_key_version)(unsigned int key_id);

  /**
    Function returning a key for a key version

    @param key_id       The requested key id
    @param version      The requested key version
    @param key          The key will be stored there. Can be NULL -
                        in which case no key will be returned
    @param key_length   in: key buffer size
                        out: the actual length of the key

    This method can be used to query the key length - the required
    buffer size - by passing key==NULL.

    If the buffer size is less than the key length the content of the
    key buffer is undefined (the plugin is free to partially fill it with
    the key data or leave it untouched).

    @return 0 on success, or
            ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION_INVALID, ENCRYPTION_KEY_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
            or any other non-zero number for errors
  */
  unsigned int (*get_key)(unsigned int key_id, unsigned int version,
                          unsigned char *key, unsigned int *key_length);

  /********************* ENCRYPTION **************************************/
  /*
    The caller uses encryption as follows:
      1. Create the encryption context object of the crypt_ctx_size() bytes.
      2. Initialize it with crypt_ctx_init().
      3. Repeat crypt_ctx_update() until there are no more data to encrypt.
      4. Write the remaining output bytes and destroy the context object
         with crypt_ctx_finish().
  */

  /**

  */
  unsigned int (*crypt_ctx_size)(unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version);
  /**
    Initializes the encryption context object.
  */
  int (*crypt_ctx_init)(void *ctx, const unsigned char *key, unsigned int klen,
                        const unsigned char *iv, unsigned int ivlen, int flags,
                        unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version);
  /**

    Writes the output to th dst buffer. note that it might write
    more bytes that were in the input. or less. or none at all.
  */
  int (*crypt_ctx_update)(void *ctx, const unsigned char *src,
                          unsigned int slen, unsigned char *dst,
                          unsigned int *dlen);
  /**

    crypt_ctx_update might've cached part of the output in the context,
    this method will flush these data out.
  */
  int (*crypt_ctx_finish)(void *ctx, unsigned char *dst, unsigned int *dlen);
  /**
    Returns the length of the encrypted data

    It returns the exact length, given only the source length.
    Which means, this API only supports encryption algorithms where
    the length of the encrypted data only depends on the length of the
    input (a.k.a. compression is not supported).
  */
  unsigned int (*encrypted_length)(unsigned int slen, unsigned int key_id,
                                   unsigned int key_version);
};
```

The first method is used for key rotation. A plugin that doesn't support key rotation — for example, **file\_key\_management** — can return a fixed version for any valid key id. Note that it still has to return an error for an invalid key id. The version `ENCRYPTION_KEY_NOT_ENCRYPTED` means that the data should not be encrypted.

The second method is used for key management, the server uses it to retrieve the key corresponding to a specific key identifier and a specific key version.

The last five methods deal with encryption. Note that they take the key to use and key identifier and version. This is needed because the server can derive a session-specific, user-specific, or a tablespace-specific key from the original encryption key as returned by `get_key()`, so the `key` argument doesn't have to match the encryption key as the plugin knows it. On the other hand, the encryption algorithm may depend on the key identifier and version (and in the **example\_key\_management** plugin it does) so the plugin needs to know them to be able to encrypt the data.

Encryption methods are optional — if unset (as in the **debug\_key\_management** plugin), the server will fall back to AES\_CBC.

## Current Encryption Plugins

The MariaDB source tree has four encryption plugins. All these plugins are fairly simple and can serve as good examples of the Encryption plugin API.

### file\_key\_management

It reads encryption keys from a plain-text file. It supports two different encryption algorithms. It supports multiple encryption keys. It does not support key rotation.\
See the [File Key Management Plugin](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/file-key-management-encryption-plugin.md) article for more details.

### aws\_key\_management

The AWS Key Management plugin uses the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to generate and store AES keys on disk, in encrypted form, using the Customer Master Key (CMK) kept in AWS KMS. When MariaDB Server starts, the plugin will decrypt the encrypted keys, using the AWS KMS "Decrypt" API function. MariaDB data will then be encrypted and decrypted using the AES key. It supports multiple encryption keys. It supports key rotation.

See the [AWS Key Management Plugin](../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/aws-key-management-encryption-plugin.md) article for more details.

## Encryption Service

Encryption is generally needed on the very low level **inside the storage engine**. That is, the storage engine needs to support encryption and have access to the encryption and key management functionality. The usual way for a plugin to access some functionality in the server is via a _service_. In this case the server provides the Encryption Service for storage engines (and other interested plugins) to use. These service functions are directly hooked into encryption plugin methods (described above).

Service functions are declared as follows:

```
unsigned int encryption_key_get_latest_version(unsigned int key_id);
unsigned int encryption_key_get(unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version,
                                unsigned char *buffer, unsigned int *length);
unsigned int encryption_ctx_size(unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version);
int encryption_ctx_init(void *ctx, const unsigned char *key, unsigned int klen,
                        const unsigned char *iv, unsigned int ivlen, int flags,
                        unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version);
int encryption_ctx_update(void *ctx, const unsigned char *src,
                          unsigned int slen, unsigned char *dst,
                          unsigned int *dlen);
int encryption_ctx_finish(void *ctx, unsigned char *dst, unsigned int *dlen);
unsigned int encryption_encrypted_length(unsigned int slen, unsigned int key_id,
                                         unsigned int key_version);
```

There are also convenience helpers to check for a key or key version existence and to encrypt or decrypt a block of data with one function call.

```
unsigned int encryption_key_id_exists(unsigned int id);
unsigned int encryption_key_version_exists(unsigned int id,
                                           unsigned int version);
int encryption_crypt(const unsigned char *src, unsigned int slen,
                     unsigned char *dst, unsigned int *dlen,
                     const unsigned char *key, unsigned int klen,
                     const unsigned char *iv, unsigned int ivlen, int flags,
                     unsigned int key_id, unsigned int key_version);
```
