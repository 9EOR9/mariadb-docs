# Creating a New Merge Tree

This article is obsolete. We don't use bzr anymore. This howto needs to be rewritten to explain how to create a merge tree in git.


**Merge tree** in the context of this HOWTO is a tree created specifically to simplify merges of third-party packages into MariaDB. WIth a merge tree there's a clear separation between upstream changes and our changes and in most cases bzr can do the merges automatically.


Here's how I created a merge tree for pcre:


* prerequisites: we already have pcre in the MariaDB tree, together with our changes (otherwise one can trivially create a bzr repository out of source pcre tarball).
* create an empty repository:


```
mkdir pcre
cd pcre
bzr init
```

* download pcre source tarball of the same version that we have in the tree — `pcre-8.34.tar.bz2`
* unpack it in the same place where the files are in the source tree:


```
tar xf ~/pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
mv pcre-8.34 pcre
```

* Add files to the repository with the same file-ids as in the MariaDB tree!


```
bzr add --file-ids-from ~/Abk/mysql/10.0
```

* All done. Commit and push


```
bzr commit -m pcre-8.34
bzr push --remember lp:~maria-captains/maria/pcre-mergetree
```

* Now null-merge that into your MariaDB tree. Note, that for the initial merge you need to specify the revision range `0..1`


```
cd ~/Abk/mysql/10.0
bzr merge -r 0..1 ~/mergetrees/pcre/
```

* Remove pcre files that shouldn't be in MariaDB tree, revert all changes that came from pcre (remember — it's a null-merge, pcre-8.34 is already in MariaDB tree), rename files in place as needed, resolve conflicts:


```
bzr rm `bzr added`
bzr revert --no-backup `bzr modified`
bzr resolve pcre
```

* Verify that the tree is unchanged and commit:


```
bzr status
bzr commit -m 'pcre-8.34 mergetree initial merge'
```

* Congratulations, your new merge tree is ready!
