## Merging from MySQL into MariaDB


### Merging code changes from MySQL bzr repository


We generally merge only released versions of MySQL into MariaDB trunk. This is
to be able to release a well-working release of MariaDB at any time, without
having to worry about including half-finished changes from MySQL. Merges of
MySQL revisions in-between MySQL releases can still be done (eg. to reduce the
merge task to smaller pieces), but should then be pushed to the maria-5.1-merge
branch, not to the main lp:maria branch.


The merge command should thus generally be of this form:


```
bzr merge -rtag:mysql-<MYSQL-VERSION> lp:mysql-server/5.1
```

As a general rule, when the MySQL and MariaDB side has changes with the same
meaning but differing text, pick the MySQL variant when resolving this
conflict. This will help reduce the number of conflicts in subsequent merges.


### Buildbot testing


To assist in understanding test failures that arise during the merge, we pull
the same revision to be merged into the
lp:maria-captains/maria/mysql-5.1-testing tree for buildbot test. This allows
to check easily if any failures introduced are also present in the vanilla
MySQL tree being merged.


### Helpful tags and diffs


To help keep track of merges, we tag the result of a merge:


```
mariadb-merge-mysql-<MYSQL-VERSION>
```

For example, when merging MySQL 5.1.39, the commit of the merge would be
tagged like this:


```
mariadb-merge-mysql-5.1.39
```

The right-hand parent of tag:mariadb-merge-mysql-5.1.39 will be the revision
tag:mysql-5.1.39. The left-hand parent will be a revision on the MariaDB
trunk.


When merging, these tags and associated revisions can be used to generate some
diffs, which are useful when resolving conflicts. Here is a diagram of the
history in a merge:


```
B----maria------A0-------A1
 \              /       /
  \            /       /
   ---mysql---Y0------Y1
```

Here,


* `'B'` is the base revision when MariaDB was originally 
 branched from MySQL.
* `'A0'` is the result of the last MySQL merge, eg. 
 `tag:mariadb-merge-mysql-5.1.38`.
* `'Y0'` is the MySQL revision that was last merged, eg. 
 `tag:mysql-5.1.38`.
* `'Y1'` is the MySQL revision to be merged in the new merge, 
 eg. `tag:mysql-5.1.39`.
* `'A1'` is the result of committing the new merge, to be 
 tagged as eg. `tag:mariadb-merge-mysql-5.1.39`.


Then, these diffs can be useful:


* `'bzr diff -rY0..before:A1'` - this is the MariaDB side of changes to be merged.
* `'bzr diff -rY0..Y1'` - this is the MySQL side of changes to be merged.
* `'bzr diff -rA0..before:A1'` - these are the new changes on the MariaDB side to be merged; this can be useful do separate them from other MariaDB-specific changes that have already been resolved against conflicting MySQL changes.


### Merging documentation from MySQL source tarballs


The documentation for MySQL is not maintained in the MySQL source bzr
repository. Therefore changes to MySQL documentation needs to be merged
separately.


Only some of the MySQL documentation is available under the GPL (man pages,
help tables, installation instructions). Notably the MySQL manual is not
available under the GPL, and so is not included in MariaDB in any form.


The man pages, help tables, and installation instruction READMEs are obtained
from MySQL source tarballs and manually merged into the MariaDB source trees.
The procedure for this is as follows:


There is a tree on Launchpad used for tracking merges:


```
lp:~maria-captains/maria/mysql-docs-merge-base
```

(At the time of writing, this procedure only exists for the 5.1 series of MySQL
and MariaDB. Additional merge base trees will be needed for other release
series.)


This tree must **only** be used to import new documentation files from new
MySQL upstream source tarballs. The procedure to import a new set of files when
a new MySQL release happens is as follows:


* Download the new MySQL source tarball and unpack it, say to mysql-5.1.38
* run these commands:


```
T=../mysql-5.1.38
bzr branch lp:~maria-captains/maria/mysql-docs-merge-base
cd mysql-docs-merge-base
for i in Docs/INSTALL-BINARY INSTALL-SOURCE INSTALL-WIN-SOURCE support-files/MacOSX/ReadMe.txt scripts/fill_help_tables.sql $(cd "$T" && find man -type f | grep '\.[0-9]$' | grep -v '^man/ndb_' | grep -v '^man/mysqlman.1$') ; do cp "$T/$i" $i; bzr add $i ; done
bzr commit -m"Imported MySQL documentation files from $T"
bzr push lp:~maria-captains/maria/mysql-docs-merge-base
```

* Now do a normal merge from `lp:maria-captains/maria/mysql-docs-merge-base` into `lp:maria`
