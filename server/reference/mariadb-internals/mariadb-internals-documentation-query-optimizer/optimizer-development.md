Notes about Optimizer Development


## mysql-test


### InnoDB Estimates are unstable


This is caused by background statistics update. It may cause the numbers in EXPLAIN output to be off-by-one. It may also cause different query plans to be picked on different runs (See e.g. [MDEV-32901](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-32901) for details)


On a per-table basis, one can use `STATS_AUTO_RECALC=0` as table parameter.


On a per-file basis, one can use this include:


```
--source mysql-test/include/innodb_stable_estimates.inc
```

### Run mtr with Optimizer Trace enabled
