## Possible Causes and Solutions


MariaDB [storage engines](../../../../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/video-presentations-and-screencasts/storage-engines-and-plugins-videos.md) differ in many ways, and not all operations are supported by each engine. Perhaps you don't need the intended operation for the engine, or perhaps you need a different storage engine. For example, [sequences](../../../../sql-statements-and-structure/sequences/README.md) don't support [analyze table](../../../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table.md), as it's an unnecessary operation on a sequence table, which only contains one row.


```
CREATE SEQUENCE s START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;

ANALYZE TABLE s;
+--------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Table  | Op      | Msg_type | Msg_text                                                 |
+--------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| test.s | analyze | note     | The storage engine for the table doesn't support analyze |
+--------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
```
