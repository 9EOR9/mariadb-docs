## Possible Causes and Solutions


This error occurs, in particular to [MyISAM](../../../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/README.md), [Aria](../../../../storage-engines/aria/README.md), [Archive](../../../../storage-engines/archive/README.md) or [CSV](../../../../storage-engines/csv/README.md) tables, if the table is marked as crashed. This can occur for a number of reasons, for example:


* running out of disk space
* sudden shutdown while the table was in use


Fixing the problem can usually be done by running a [REPAIR TABLE](../../../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/table-statements/repair-table.md) statement, or one of the similar scripts, [aria_chk](../../../../../clients-and-utilities/aria-clients-and-utilities/aria_chk.md), [myisamchk](../../../../../clients-and-utilities/myisam-clients-and-utilities/myisamchk.md) or [mariadb-check](../../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-check.md).
