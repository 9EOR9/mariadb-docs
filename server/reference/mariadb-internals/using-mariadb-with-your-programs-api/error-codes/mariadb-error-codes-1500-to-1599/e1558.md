## Possible Causes and Solutions


### Not upgrading properly


This error likely means an upgrade hasn't been performed properly, as one of the system tables does not match the expected size for the running release. [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-upgrade.md) usually takes care of this. See [Upgrading Between Major MariaDB Versions](../../../../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/upgrading/upgrading-between-major-mariadb-versions.md).
