# Authentication Plugin - ed25519

MySQL has used SHA-1 based authentication since version 4.1. The authentication plugin is called [mysql\_native\_password](authentication-plugin-mysql_native_password.md). Over the years as computers became faster, new attacks on SHA-1 were being developed. Nowadays SHA-1 is no longer considered as secure as it was in 2001. That's why the `ed25519` authentication plugin was created.

The `ed25519` authentication plugin uses [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) to securely store users' passwords and to authenticate users. The [ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) algorithm is the same one that is [used by OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.5). It is based on the elliptic curve and code created by [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein).

From a user's perspective, the `ed25519` authentication plugin still provides conventional password-based authentication.

## Installing the Plugin

Although the plugin's shared library is distributed with MariaDB by default as `auth_ed25519.so` or `auth_ed25519.dll` depending on the operating system, the plugin is not actually installed by MariaDB by default. There are two methods that can be used to install the plugin with MariaDB.

The first method can be used to install the plugin without restarting the server. You can install the plugin dynamically by executing [INSTALL SONAME](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/install-soname.md) or [INSTALL PLUGIN](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/install-plugin.md). For example:

```
INSTALL SONAME 'auth_ed25519';
```

The second method can be used to tell the server to load the plugin when it starts up. The plugin can be installed this way by providing the [--plugin-load](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-plugin-load) or the [--plugin-load-add](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-plugin-load-add) options. This can be specified as a command-line argument to [mariadbd](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md) or it can be specified in a relevant server [option group](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md#option-groups) in an [option file](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md). For example:

```
[mariadb]
...
plugin_load_add = auth_ed25519
```

## Uninstalling the Plugin

You can uninstall the plugin dynamically by executing [UNINSTALL SONAME](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/uninstall-soname.md) or [UNINSTALL PLUGIN](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/uninstall-plugin.md). For example:

```
UNINSTALL SONAME 'auth_ed25519';
```

If you installed the plugin by providing the [--plugin-load](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-plugin-load) or the [--plugin-load-add](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-plugin-load-add) options in a relevant server [option group](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md#option-groups) in an [option file](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), then those options should be removed to prevent the plugin from being loaded the next time the server is restarted.

## Creating Users

You can create a user account by executing the [CREATE USER](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md) statement and providing the [IDENTIFIED VIA](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md#identified-viawith-authentication_plugin) clause followied by the the name of the plugin, which is `ed25519`, and providing the the `USING` clause followed by the [PASSWORD()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password.md) function with the plain-text password as an argument. For example:

```
CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 USING PASSWORD('secret');
```

If [SQL\_MODE](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) does not have `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` set, then you can also create the user account via [GRANT](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md). For example:

```
GRANT SELECT ON db.* TO username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 USING PASSWORD('secret');
```

<>

The [PASSWORD()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password.md) function and [SET PASSWORD](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/set-password.md) statement did not work with the `ed25519` authentication plugin. Instead, you would have to use the [UDF](../../../server-usage/user-defined-functions/) that comes with the authentication plugin to calculate the password hash. For example:

```
CREATE FUNCTION ed25519_password RETURNS STRING SONAME "auth_ed25519.so";
```

Now you can calculate a password hash by executing:

```
SELECT ed25519_password("secret");
+---------------------------------------------+
| SELECT ed25519_password("secret");          |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ZIgUREUg5PVgQ6LskhXmO+eZLS0nC8be6HPjYWR4YJY |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

Now you can use it to create the user account using the new password hash.\
As with any password, you should always use a complex password that no one can guess. If not, if anyone gets access to the stored passwords in the mysql.user table, they could use rainbow tables to figure out the original password.

To create a user account via [CREATE USER](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md), specify the name of the plugin in the [IDENTIFIED VIA](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md#identified-viawith-authentication_plugin) clause while providing the password hash as the `USING` clause. For example:

```
CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 
  USING 'ZIgUREUg5PVgQ6LskhXmO+eZLS0nC8be6HPjYWR4YJY';
```

If [SQL\_MODE](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) does not have `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` set, then you can also create the user account via [GRANT](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md). For example:

```
GRANT SELECT ON db.* TO username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 
  USING 'ZIgUREUg5PVgQ6LskhXmO+eZLS0nC8be6HPjYWR4YJY';
```

<>

Note that users require a password in order to be able to connect. It is possible to create a user without specifying a password, but they will be unable to connect.

## Changing User Passwords

You can change a user account's password by executing the [SET PASSWORD](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/set-password.md) statement followed by the [PASSWORD()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password.md) function and providing the plain-text password as an argument. For example:

```
SET PASSWORD =  PASSWORD('new_secret')
```

You can also change the user account's password with the [ALTER USER](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/alter-user.md) statement. You would have to specify the name of the plugin in the [IDENTIFIED VIA](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/alter-user.md#identified-viawith-authentication_plugin) clause while providing the plain-text password as an argument to the [PASSWORD()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password.md) function in the `USING` clause. For example:

```
ALTER USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 USING PASSWORD('new_secret');
```

The [PASSWORD()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password.md) function and [SET PASSWORD](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/set-password.md) statement did not work with the `ed25519` authentication plugin. Instead, you would have to use the [UDF](../../../server-usage/user-defined-functions/) that comes with the authentication plugin to calculate the password hash. For example:

```
CREATE FUNCTION ed25519_password RETURNS STRING SONAME "auth_ed25519.so";
```

Now you can calculate a password hash by executing:

```
SELECT ed25519_password("secret");
+---------------------------------------------+
| SELECT ed25519_password("secret");          |
+---------------------------------------------+
| ZIgUREUg5PVgQ6LskhXmO+eZLS0nC8be6HPjYWR4YJY |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

Now you can change the user account's password using the new password hash.

You can change the user account's password with the [ALTER USER](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/alter-user.md) statement. You would have to specify the name of the plugin in the [IDENTIFIED VIA](../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/alter-user.md#identified-viawith-authentication_plugin) clause while providing the password hash as the `USING` clause. For example:

```
ALTER USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED VIA ed25519 
  USING 'ZIgUREUg5PVgQ6LskhXmO+eZLS0nC8be6HPjYWR4YJY';
```

## Client Authentication Plugins

For clients that use the `libmysqlclient` or [MariaDB Connector/C](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-c) libraries, MariaDB provides one client authentication plugin that is compatible with the `ed25519` authentication plugin:

* `client_ed25519`

When connecting with a [client or utility](../../../../kb/en/clients-utilities/) to a server as a user account that authenticates with the `ed25519` authentication plugin, you may need to tell the client where to find the relevant client authentication plugin by specifying the `--plugin-dir` option. For example:

```
mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/local/mysql/lib64/mysql/plugin --user=alice
```

### `client_ed25519`

The `client_ed25519` client authentication plugin hashes and signs the password using the [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) before sending it to the server.

## Support in Client Libraries
