# MariaDB Audit Plugin - Status Variables

There are a few status variables related to the [MariaDB Audit Plugin](./), once it has been [installed](mariadb-audit-plugin-installation.md). These variables can be displayed using the [SHOW STATUS](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status.md) statement like so:

```
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'server_audit%';

+----------------------------+------------------+
| Variable_name              | Value            |
+----------------------------+------------------+
| Server_audit_active        | ON               |
| Server_audit_current_log   | server_audit.log |
| Server_audit_last_error    |                  |
| Server_audit_writes_failed | 0                |
+----------------------------+------------------+
```
