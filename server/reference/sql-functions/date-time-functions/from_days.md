# FROM\_DAYS

## Syntax

```sql
FROM_DAYS(N)
```

## Description

Given a day number N, returns a DATE value. The day count is based on the number of days from the start of the standard calendar (0000-00-00).

The function is not designed for use with dates before the advent of the Gregorian calendar in October 1582. Results will not be reliable since it doesn't account for the lost days when the calendar changed from the Julian calendar.

This is the converse of the [TO\_DAYS()](to_days.md) function.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT FROM_DAYS(730669);
+-------------------+
| FROM_DAYS(730669) |
+-------------------+
| 2000-07-03        |
+-------------------+
```
