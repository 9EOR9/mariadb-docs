# FROM\_UNIXTIME

## Syntax

```
FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp)
FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp,format)
```

## Description

Converts the number of seconds from the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to a`TIMESTAMP` value, the opposite of what [UNIX_TIMESTAMP()](unix_timestamp.md) is doing. Returns NULL if the result would be outside of the valid range of `TIMESTAMP` values.

If format is given, the result is exactly equivalent to

```
DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp), format)
```

**MariaDB until** [**11.7**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117)

Before [MariaDB 11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117), the one-argument form of `FROM_UNIXTIME()` was returning a`DATETIME`. Meaning, it could return values outside of valid `TIMESTAMP` range,\
in particular 1970-01-01 00:00:00. And it could return the same result for different values of unix\_timestamp (around DST changes).

Timestamps in MariaDB have a maximum value of 4294967295, equivalent to 2106-02-07 06:28:15. This is due to the underlying 32-bit limitation. Using the function on a timestamp beyond this will result in NULL being returned. Use [DATETIME](../../data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime.md) as a storage type if you require dates beyond this.

**MariaDB until** [**11.5**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115)

The options that can be used by FROM\_UNIXTIME(), as well as [DATE\_FORMAT()](date_format.md) and [STR\_TO\_DATE()](str_to_date.md), are:

## Performance Considerations

If your [session time zone](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#time_zone) is set to `SYSTEM` (the default), `FROM_UNIXTIME()` will call the OS function to convert the data using the system time zone. At least on Linux, the corresponding function (`localtime_r`) uses a global mutex inside glibc that can cause contention under high concurrent load.

Set your time zone to a named time zone to avoid this issue. See [mysql time zone tables](../../data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md#mysql-time-zone-tables) for details on how to do this.

## Examples

```
SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(1196440219);
+---------------------------+
| FROM_UNIXTIME(1196440219) |
+---------------------------+
| 2007-11-30 11:30:19       |
+---------------------------+

SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(1196440219) + 0;
+-------------------------------+
| FROM_UNIXTIME(1196440219) + 0 |
+-------------------------------+
|         20071130113019.000000 |
+-------------------------------+

SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), '%Y %D %M %h:%i:%s %x');
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), '%Y %D %M %h:%i:%s %x') |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| 2010 27th March 01:03:47 2010                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
