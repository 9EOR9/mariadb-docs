# HOUR

## Syntax

```
HOUR(time)
```

## Description

Returns the hour for time. The range of the return value is 0 to 23 for time-of-day values. However, the range of `TIME` values actually is much larger, so HOUR can return values greater than 23.

The return value is always positive, even if a negative `TIME` value is provided.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT HOUR('10:05:03');
+------------------+
| HOUR('10:05:03') |
+------------------+
|               10 |
+------------------+

SELECT HOUR('272:59:59');
+-------------------+
| HOUR('272:59:59') |
+-------------------+
|               272 |
+-------------------+
```
