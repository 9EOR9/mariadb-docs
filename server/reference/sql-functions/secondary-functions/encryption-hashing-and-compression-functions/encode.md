# ENCODE

## Syntax

```sql
ENCODE(str,pass_str)
```

## Description

{% hint style="warning" %}
`ENCODE` is not considered cryptographically secure, and should not be used for password encryption.
{% endhint %}

Encrypt `str` using `pass_str` as the password. To decrypt the result, use[DECODE()](decode.md).

The result is a binary string of the same length as `str`.

The strength of the encryption is based on how good the random generator is.

It is not recommended to rely on the encryption performed by the ENCODE function. Using a salt value (changed when a password is updated) will improve matters somewhat, but for storing passwords, consider a more cryptographically secure function, such as [SHA2()](sha2.md).

## Examples

```sql
ENCODE('not so secret text', CONCAT('random_salt','password'))
```
