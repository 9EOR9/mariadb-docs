# OLD\_PASSWORD

## Syntax

```sql
OLD_PASSWORD(str)
```

## Description

`OLD_PASSWORD()` was added to MySQL when the implementation of [PASSWORD()](password.md) was changed to improve security. `OLD_PASSWORD()` returns the value of the old (pre-MySQL 4.1) implementation of `PASSWORD()` as a string, and is intended to permit you to reset passwords for any pre-4.1 clients that need to connect to a more recent MySQL server version, or any version of MariaDB, without locking them out.

The return value is a nonbinary string in the connection [character set and collation](../../../data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/), determined by the values of the [character\_set\_connection](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#character_set_connection) and [collation\_connection](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#collation_connection) system variables.

The return value is 16 bytes in length, or `NULL` if the argument was `NULL`.
