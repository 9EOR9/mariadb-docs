# FROM_BASE64

## Syntax


```
FROM_BASE64(str)
```

## Description


Decodes the given base-64 encode string, returning the result as a binary string. Returns `NULL` if the given string is `NULL` or if it's invalid.


It is the reverse of the [TO_BASE64](to_base64.md) function.


There are numerous methods to base-64 encode a string. MariaDB uses the following:


* It encodes alphabet value 64 as '`+`'.
* It encodes alphabet value 63 as '`/`'.
* It codes output in groups of four printable characters. Each three byte of data encoded uses four characters. If the final group is incomplete, it pads the difference with the '`=`' character.
* It divides long output, adding a new line very 76 characters.
* In decoding, it recognizes and ignores newlines, carriage returns, tabs and space whitespace characters.


```
