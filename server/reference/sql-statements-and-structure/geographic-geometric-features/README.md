# Geographic & Geometric Features

MariaDB supports spatial extensions that enable the creation, storage and analysis of geographic features. These can be used in the [Aria](../../storage-engines/s3-storage-engine/aria_s3_copy.md), [MyISAM](../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md), [InnoDB/XtraDB](../../../../general-resources/learning-and-training/training-and-tutorials/advanced-mariadb-articles/development-articles/quality/innodb-upgrade-tests/README.md) and [ARCHIVE](../../storage-engines/archive/README.md) engines in MariaDB.


[Partitioned tables](../../../server-management/partitioning-tables/README.md) do not support geometric types.
