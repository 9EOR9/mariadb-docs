# Geographic & Geometric Features

MariaDB supports spatial extensions that enable the creation, storage and analysis of geographic features. These can be used in the [Aria](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/aria-encryption/aria-enabling-encryption.md), [MyISAM](../../../clients-and-utilities/myisam-clients-and-utilities/myisamchk-table-information.md), [InnoDB/XtraDB](../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/innodb-encryption/innodb-encryption-troubleshooting.md) and [ARCHIVE](/en/archive/) engines in MariaDB.

[Partitioned tables](/en/managing-mariadb-partitioning/) do not support geometric types.
