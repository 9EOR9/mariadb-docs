# Sequences

This section is about sequence objects. For details about the storage engine, see [Sequence Storage Engine](../../storage-engines/sequence-storage-engine.md).

A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the [CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence.md) statement. Sequences are an alternative to [AUTO\_INCREMENT](../../data-types/auto_increment.md) when you want more control over how sequence numbers are generated.

Since a `SEQUENCE` caches values, it can sometimes be faster. Also, you can access the last value generated by all used sequences; it's not subjected to limitations of [LAST\_INSERT\_ID( )](../../sql-statements/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_insert_id.md).
