# Sequences

This section is about sequence objects. For details about the storage engine, see [Sequence Storage Engine](../../storage-engines/sequence-storage-engine.md).


A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the [CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence.md) statement. Sequences are an alternative to [AUTO_INCREMENT](../../storage-engines/innodb/auto_increment-handling-in-innodb.md) when you want more control over how sequence numbers are generated.


Since a `<code>SEQUENCE</code>` caches values, it can sometimes be faster. Also, you can access the last value generated by all used sequences; it's not subjected to limitations of [LAST_INSERT_ID( )](../sql-statements/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_insert_id.md).
