# Reserved Words


The following is a list of all reserved words in MariaDB.


Reserved words cannot be used as [Identifiers](identifier-names.md), unless they are quoted.


The definitive list of reserved words for each version can be found by examining the `sql/lex.h` and `sql/sql_yacc.yy` files.
