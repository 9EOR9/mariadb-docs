# BINLOG

## Syntax


```
BINLOG 'str'
```

## Description


`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the
[mariadb-binlog](../../../../../connectors/mariadb-connector-c/mariadb-binlogreplication-api-reference.md) program as the printable representation of certain events in [binary log](../../../storage-engines/innodb/binary-log-group-commit-and-innodb-flushing-performance.md) files. The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded
string that the server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the
corresponding event. This statement requires the [SUPER](../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#super) privilege (<= [MariaDB 10.5.1](../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes.md)) or the [BINLOG REPLAY](../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#binlog-replay) privilege (>= [MariaDB 10.5.2](../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes.md)).
