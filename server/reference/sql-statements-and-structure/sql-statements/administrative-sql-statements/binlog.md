## Description

`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the[mariadb-binlog](../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-binlog/) program as the printable representation of certain events in [binary log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) files. The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded\
string that the server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the\
corresponding event.
