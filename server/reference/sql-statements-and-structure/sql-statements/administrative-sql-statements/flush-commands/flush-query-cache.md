# FLUSH QUERY CACHE

#

# Description

You can defragment [the query cache](/en/the-query-cache/) to better utilize its memory with
the `FLUSH QUERY CACHE` statement. The statement does not remove any queries from the cache.

The [RESET QUERY CACHE](../reset.md) statement removes all query results from the query cache.
The [FLUSH TABLES](flush-tables-for-export.md) statement also does this.
