# FLUSH QUERY CACHE

## Description


You can defragment [the query cache](../../../../plugins/other-plugins/query-cache-information-plugin.md) to better utilize its memory with
the `<code>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</code>` statement. The statement does not remove any queries from the cache.


The [RESET QUERY CACHE](../replication-statements/reset-master.md) statement removes all query results from the query cache.
The [FLUSH TABLES](flush-tables-for-export.md) statement also does this.
