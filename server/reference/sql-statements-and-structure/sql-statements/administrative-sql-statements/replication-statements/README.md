# Replication Statements

The terms *master* and *slave* have historically been used in replication, and MariaDB has begun the process of adding *primary* and *replica* synonyms. The old terms will continue to be used to maintain backward compatibility - see [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777) to follow progress on this effort.


A list of replication-related statements. See [replication](README.md) for more replication-related information.
