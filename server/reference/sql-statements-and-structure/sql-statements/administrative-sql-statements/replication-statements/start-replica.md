# START REPLICA

The terms *master* and *slave* have historically been used in replication, and MariaDB has begun the process of adding *primary* and *replica* synonyms. The old terms will continue to be used to maintain backward compatibility - see [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777) to follow progress on this effort.



## Syntax


```
START REPLICA ["connection_name"] [thread_type [, thread_type] ... ]
START REPLICA ["connection_name"] [SQL_THREAD] UNTIL                
    MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = log_pos 
START REPLICA ["connection_name"] [SQL_THREAD] UNTIL
    RELAY_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', RELAY_LOG_POS = log_pos 
START REPLICA ["connection_name"] [SQL_THREAD] UNTIL
    MASTER_GTID_POS = <GTID position> 
START ALL REPLICAS [thread_type [, thread_type]] 

thread_type: IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD
```


## Description


`<code>START REPLICA</code>` (`<code>START REPLICA</code>` from [MariaDB 10.5.1](../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes.md)) with no thread_type options starts both of the replica threads (see [replication](README.md)) needed to connect with a master setup with [CHANGE MASTER TO](change-master-to.md) .
 The I/O thread reads events from the primary server and stores
them in the [relay log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/relay-log.md). The SQL thread reads events from the relay log
and executes them. `<code>START REPLICA</code>` requires the [SUPER](../../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#super) privilege, or, from [MariaDB 10.5.2](../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes.md), the [REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN](../../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md#replication-slave-admin) privilege.


If `<code>START REPLICA</code>` succeeds in starting the replica threads, it returns
without any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the
replica threads start and then later stop (for example, because they do
not manage to connect to the primary or read its [binary log](../../../../storage-engines/innodb/binary-log-group-commit-and-innodb-flushing-performance.md), or some
other problem). `<code>START REPLICA</code>` does not warn you about this. You must
check the replica's [error log](../../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md) for error messages generated by the replica
threads, or check that they are running satisfactorily with [SHOW REPLICA
STATUS](../show/show-replica-status.md) ([SHOW REPLICA STATUS](../show/show-replica-status.md)).


#### START REPLICA UNTIL


`<code>START REPLICA UNTIL</code>` refers to the `<code>SQL_THREAD</code>` replica position at which the `<code>SQL_THREAD</code>` replication will halt. If `<code>SQL_THREAD</code>` isn't specified both threads are started.


`<code>START REPLICA UNTIL master_gtid_pos=xxx</code>` is also supported. See [Global Transaction ID/START REPLICA UNTIL master_gtid_pos=xxx](../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/gtid.md) for more details.



##### MariaDB starting with [11.3.0](/en/mariadb-1130-release-notes/)

##### SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS|SQL_AFTER_GTIDS

[MariaDB 11.3](../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-113.md) extended the START REPLICA UNTIL command with the options `<code>SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS</code>` and `<code>SQL_AFTER_GTIDS</code>` to allow control of whether the replica stops before or after a provided GTID state. Its
syntax is:

```
START REPLICA UNTIL (SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS|SQL_AFTER_GTIDS)="<gtid_list>"
```
See [Global Transaction ID#SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS/SQL_AFTER_GTIDS](../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/gtid.md#sql_before_gtidssql_after_gtids) for details.


#### connection_name


If there is only one nameless primary, or the default primary (as specified by the [default_master_connection](../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) system variable) is intended, `<code>connection_name</code>` can be omitted. If provided, the `<code>START REPLICA</code>` statement will apply to the specified primary. `<code>connection_name</code>` is case-insensitive.



##### MariaDB starting with [10.7.0](../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-7-series/mariadb-1070-release-notes.md)
The `<code>FOR CHANNEL</code>` keyword was added for MySQL compatibility. This is identical as
using the channel_name directly after `<code>START REPLICA</code>`.


#### START ALL REPLICAS


`<code>START ALL REPLICAS</code>` starts all configured replicas (replicas with master_host not empty) that were not started before. It will give a `<code>note</code>` for all started connections. You can check the notes with [SHOW WARNINGS](../show/show-warnings.md).
