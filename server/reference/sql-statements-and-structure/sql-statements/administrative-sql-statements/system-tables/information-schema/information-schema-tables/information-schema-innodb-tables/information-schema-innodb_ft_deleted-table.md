# Information Schema INNODB_FT_DELETED Table

The [Information Schema](../../README.md) `INNODB_FT_DELETED` table contains rows that have been deleted from an InnoDB [fulltext index](../../../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/README.md). This information is then used to filter results on subsequent searches, removing the need to expensively reorganise the index each time a row is deleted.


The fulltext index is then only reorganized when an [OPTIMIZE TABLE](../../../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/optimize-table.md) statement is underway. The related [INNODB_FT_BEING_DELETED](information-schema-innodb_ft_being_deleted-table.md) table contains rows being deleted while an `OPTIMIZE TABLE` is in the process of running.


The `SUPER` [privilege](../../../../../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md) is required to view the table, and it also requires the [innodb_ft_aux_table](../../../../../../../storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_ft_aux_table) system variable to be set.


It has the following column:



| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Column | Description |
| DOC_ID | Document ID of the deleted row deleted. Either an underlying ID value, or a sequence value generated by InnoDB if no usable option exists. |



## Example


```
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DELETED;
+--------+
| DOC_ID |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+

DELETE FROM test.ft_innodb LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DELETED;
+--------+
| DOC_ID |
+--------+
|      2 |
|      3 |
+--------+
```
