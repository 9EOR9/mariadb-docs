# Information Schema ROUTINES Table

The [Information Schema](../) `ROUTINES` table stores information about [stored procedures](../../../../../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/) and [stored functions](../../../../../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-functions/).

It contains the following columns:

It provides information similar to, but more complete, than the `[SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS](../../../show/show-procedure-status.md)` and `[SHOW FUNCTION STATUS](../../../show/show-function-status.md)` statements.

For information about the parameters accepted by the routine, you can query the `[information_schema.PARAMETERS](information-schema-parameters-table.md)` table.
