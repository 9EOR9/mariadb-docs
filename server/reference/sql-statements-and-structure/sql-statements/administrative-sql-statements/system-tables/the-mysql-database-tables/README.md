# The mysql Database Tables

MariaDB comes pre-installed with a system database called `<code>mysql</code>` containing many important tables storing, in particular, [grant and privilege](../../../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md) information. Before [MariaDB 10.4](../../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-104.md), system tables used the [MyISAM](../../../../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md) storage engine. From [MariaDB 10.4](../../../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-104.md), they use [Aria](../../../../../storage-engines/s3-storage-engine/aria_s3_copy.md).
