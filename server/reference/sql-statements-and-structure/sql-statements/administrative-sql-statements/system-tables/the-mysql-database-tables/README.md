# The mysql Database Tables

MariaDB comes pre-installed with a system database called `mysql` containing many important tables storing, in particular, [grant and privilege](../../../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md) information. Before [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-104), system tables used the [MyISAM](../../../../../../clients-and-utilities/myisam-clients-and-utilities/myisamchk-table-information.md) storage engine. From [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-104), they use [Aria](../../../../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/encryption-data-at-rest-encryption/aria-encryption/aria-enabling-encryption.md).
