The RANDOM_BYTES function generates a binary string of random bytes. It was added in [MariaDB 10.10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/mariadb-10100-release-notes).


## Syntax


```
RANDOM_BYTES(length)
```

## Description


Given a *length* from 1 to 1024, generates a binary string of *length* consisting of random bytes generated by the SSL library's random number generator.


See the RAND_bytes() function documentation of your SSL library for information on the random number generator. In the case of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/RAND_bytes.html), a cryptographically secure pseudo random generator (CSPRNG) is used.


Statements containing the RANDOM_BYTES function are [unsafe for statement-based replication](../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/unsafe-statements-for-statement-based-replication.md).


An error occurs if *length* is outside the range 1 to 1024.
