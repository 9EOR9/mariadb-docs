# PERCENTILE_DISC

## Syntax



## Description


`PERCENTILE_DISC()` (standing for discrete percentile) is a [window function](window-functions-overview.md) which returns the first value in the set whose ordered position is the same or more than the specified fraction.


Essentially, the following process is followed to find the value to return:


* Get the number of rows in the partition.
* Walk through the partition, in order, until finding the the first row with [CUME_DIST()](cume_dist.md) >= function_argument.

INSERT INTO book_rating VALUES ('Lord of the Ladybirds', 5);

INSERT INTO book_rating VALUES ('Lady of the Flies', 1);
INSERT INTO book_rating VALUES ('Lady of the Flies', 2);
INSERT INTO book_rating VALUES ('Lady of the Flies', 5);

SELECT name, PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY star_rating)
  OVER (PARTITION BY name) AS pc FROM book_rating;
