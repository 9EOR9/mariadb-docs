# WITH

### Syntax


```
WITH [RECURSIVE] table_reference [(columns_list)] AS  (
  SELECT ...
)
[CYCLE cycle_column_list RESTRICT]
SELECT ...
```


### Description


The `WITH` keyword signifies a [Common Table Expression](README.md) (CTE). It allows you to refer to a subquery expression many times in a query, as if having a temporary table that only exists for the duration of a query.


There are two kinds of CTEs:


* [Non-Recursive](non-recursive-common-table-expressions-overview.md)
* [Recursive](recursive-common-table-expressions-overview.md) (signified by the `RECURSIVE` keyword, supported since [MariaDB 10.2.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1022-release-notes))


You can use `table_reference` as any normal table in the external `SELECT` part. You can also use `WITH` in subqueries, as well as with [EXPLAIN](../../../administrative-sql-statements/analyze-and-explain-statements/explain.md) and [SELECT](../select.md).


Poorly-formed recursive CTEs can in theory cause infinite loops. The [max_recursive_iterations](../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_recursive_iterations) system variable limits the number of recursions.


#### CYCLE ... RESTRICT



##### MariaDB starting with [10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)
The CYCLE clause enables CTE cycle detection, avoiding excessive or infinite loops,
MariaDB supports a relaxed, non-standard grammar.
The SQL Standard permits a CYCLE clause, as follows:

```
WITH RECURSIVE ... (
  ...
)
CYCLE <cycle column list>
SET <cycle mark column> TO <cycle mark value> DEFAULT <non-cycle mark value>
USING <path column>
```
where all clauses are mandatory. 
MariaDB does not support this, but from 10.5.2 permits a non-standard relaxed grammar, as follows:

```
WITH RECURSIVE ... (
  ...
)
CYCLE <cycle column list> RESTRICT
```
With the use of `CYCLE ... RESTRICT` it makes no difference whether the CTE uses `UNION ALL` or `UNION DISTINCT` anymore. `UNION ALL` means "all rows, but without cycles", which is exactly what the `CYCLE` clause enables. And `UNION DISTINCT` means all rows should be different, which, again, is what will happen â€” as uniqueness is enforced over a subset of columns, complete rows will automatically all be different.


### Examples


Below is an example with the `WITH` at the top level:


```
WITH t AS (SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE b >= 'c') 
  SELECT * FROM t2, t WHERE t2.c = t.a;
```

The example below uses `WITH` in a subquery:


```
SELECT t1.a, t1.b FROM t1, t2
  WHERE t1.a > t2.c 
     AND t2.c IN(WITH t AS (SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a < 5)
                SELECT t2.c FROM t2, t WHERE t2.c = t.a);
```

Below is an example of a Recursive CTE:


```
WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS 
 ( SELECT * FROM folks
   WHERE name="Alex"
   UNION
   SELECT f.*
   FROM folks AS f, ancestors AS a
   WHERE f.id = a.father OR f.id = a.mother )
SELECT * FROM ancestors;
```

Take the following structure, and data,


```
CREATE TABLE t1 (from_ int, to_ int);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,2), (1,100), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1);
SELECT * FROM t1;
+-------+------+
| from_ | to_  |
+-------+------+
|     1 |    2 |
|     1 |  100 |
|     2 |    3 |
|     3 |    4 |
|     4 |    1 |
+-------+------+
```

Given the above, the following query would theoretically result in an infinite loop due to the last record in t1 (note that [max_recursive_iterations](../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_recursive_iterations) is set to 10 for the purposes of this example, to avoid the excessive number of cycles):


```
SET max_recursive_iterations=10;

WITH RECURSIVE cte (depth, from_, to_) AS ( 
  SELECT 0,1,1 UNION DISTINCT SELECT depth+1, t1.from_, t1.to_ 
    FROM t1, cte  WHERE t1.from_ = cte.to_ 
) 
SELECT * FROM cte;
+-------+-------+------+
| depth | from_ | to_  |
+-------+-------+------+
|     0 |     1 |    1 |
|     1 |     1 |    2 |
|     1 |     1 |  100 |
|     2 |     2 |    3 |
|     3 |     3 |    4 |
|     4 |     4 |    1 |
|     5 |     1 |    2 |
|     5 |     1 |  100 |
|     6 |     2 |    3 |
|     7 |     3 |    4 |
|     8 |     4 |    1 |
|     9 |     1 |    2 |
|     9 |     1 |  100 |
|    10 |     2 |    3 |
+-------+-------+------+
```

However, the CYCLE ... RESTRICT clause (from [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/release-notes-mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)) can overcome this:


```
WITH RECURSIVE cte (depth, from_, to_) AS ( 
  SELECT 0,1,1 UNION SELECT depth+1, t1.from_, t1.to_ 
    FROM t1, cte WHERE t1.from_ = cte.to_ 
) 
CYCLE from_, to_ RESTRICT 
SELECT * FROM cte;
+-------+-------+------+
| depth | from_ | to_  |
+-------+-------+------+
|     0 |     1 |    1 |
|     1 |     1 |    2 |
|     1 |     1 |  100 |
|     2 |     2 |    3 |
|     3 |     3 |    4 |
|     4 |     4 |    1 |
+-------+-------+------+
```
