# ANALYZE TABLE

## Syntax


```
ANALYZE [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL] TABLE tbl_name [,tbl_name ...]
  [PERSISTENT FOR 
    { ALL
      | COLUMNS ([col_name [,col_name ...]]) INDEXES ([index_name [,index_name ...]])
    }
  ]
```


## Description


`ANALYZE TABLE` analyzes and stores the key distribution for a
table ([index statistics](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/index-statistics.md)). This statement works with [MyISAM](../../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/README.md), [Aria](../../../storage-engines/aria/README.md) and [InnoDB](../../../storage-engines/innodb/README.md) tables. During the analysis, InnoDB will allow reads/writes, and MyISAM/Aria reads/inserts. For MyISAM tables, this statement is equivalent to using [myisamchk --analyze](../../../../clients-and-utilities/myisam-clients-and-utilities/myisamchk.md).


ANALYZE uses histograms, which can provide a better selectivity than InnoDB statistics offer. InnoDB statistics work with a limited sample set and is therefore not as accurate as persistent statistics can be. For more information on how the analysis works within InnoDB, see
[InnoDB Limitations](../../../storage-engines/innodb/innodb-limitations.md#table-analysis).


MariaDB uses the stored key distribution to decide the order in which
tables should be joined when you perform a join on something other than
a constant. In addition, key distributions can be used when deciding
which indexes to use for a specific table within a query.


This statement requires [SELECT and INSERT privileges](../account-management-sql-commands/grant.md) for the table.


By default, ANALYZE TABLE statements are written to the [binary log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/README.md) and will be [replicated](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/README.md). The `NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG` keyword (`LOCAL` is an alias) will ensure the statement is not written to the binary log.


From [MariaDB 10.3.19](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-10319-release-notes), `ANALYZE TABLE` statements are not logged to the binary log if [read_only](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#read_only) is set. See also [Read-Only Replicas](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/standard-replication/read-only-replicas.md).


From [MariaDB 10.6.16](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/release-notes-mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-10-6-16-release-notes) `ANALYZE TABLE` is non-blocking and non-intrusive. A connection will start using new statistics for the query following the completion of the `ANALYZE TABLE`.


`ANALYZE TABLE` is also supported for partitioned tables. You
can use `[ALTER TABLE](../data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) ... ANALYZE PARTITION` to analyze one or
more partitions.


The [Aria](../../../storage-engines/aria/README.md) storage engine supports [progress reporting](../../../mariadb-internals/using-mariadb-with-your-programs-api/progress-reporting.md) for the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement.


## Performance Impact


Note that analyzing tables with ANALYZE can have a performance impact and can use a lot of disk space for big tables. As column statistics usually do not change much over time, even when the table grows, there is no benefit to running ANALYZE very often.


Running ANALYZE is indicated:


* for newly populated tables,
* for tables that have additional columns added that are used in WHERE clauses,
* when a table has doubled in size,
* when you note that a query becomes slow because the table order has changed and you can see from [EXPLAIN](../administrative-sql-statements/analyze-and-explain-statements/explain.md) or [ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON](../administrative-sql-statements/analyze-and-explain-statements/analyze-format-json.md) that the selectivity is wrong for a table.


ANALYZE isnâ€™t useful for table columns of type UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, TIME, or CURRENT_TIME. In ANALYZE queries, you should omit columns of those types.


## Engine-Independent Statistics / PERSISTENT FOR


`ANALYZE TABLE` supports [engine-independent statistics](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/engine-independent-table-statistics.md). See [Engine-Independent Table Statistics: Collecting Statistics with the ANALYZE TABLE Statement](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/engine-independent-table-statistics.md#collecting-statistics-with-the-analyze-table-statement) for more information.


Engine-independent statistics can be controlled (enabled and disabled) using the [use_stat_tables variable](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#use_stat_tables) and the [optimizer_use_condition_selectivity variable](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#optimizer_use_condition_selectivity). InnoDB-persistent statistics are controlled with the [innodb_stats_persistent variable](../../../storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_stats_persistent). Combining both kinds of statistics is possible.


The server relies on InnoDB statistics by default. That way, it can use some statistics even if `ANALYZE TABLE` is never run (or not often enough). This gives good enough results for the majority of queries. Some queries, however, need more statistical data so the optimizer can create a good plan. Slow queries indicate there aren't enough statistical data. Those queries can be accelerated by running `ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR ...`, where `tbl` indicates a table used by a slow query. You can also run `ANALYZE TABLE ... PERSISTENT FOR ALL`, but that has a significant performance impact.


## Useful Variables


The following overview indicates when a particular variable was introduced. When multiple versions are given, it means variable options (like the default value) changed between the indicated versions.



| Variable | Introduced in MariaDB version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | Introduced in MariaDB version | Description |
| [analyze_sample_percentage](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#analyze_sample_percentage) | 10.4.3 | Percentage of rows from the table ANALYZE TABLE will sample to collect table statistics. Set to 0 to let MariaDB decide what percentage of rows to sample. |
| [histogram_type](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#histogram_type) | 10.4.3-11.0 | Specifies the type of histograms created by ANALYZE. Options are #SINGLE_PREC_HB,DOUBLE_PREC_HB or JSON_HB. |
| [histogram_size](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#histogram_size) | 10.7 | Number of bytes or buckets (in case of JSON_HB) used for storing the histogram. If set to 0, no histograms are created by ANALYZE.]] |
| [log_slow_admin_statements](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#log_slow_admin_statements) | 11.0.1 | Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other administrative statements to the slow log if it is open. Deprecated. Use [log_slow_filter](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#log_slow_filter) instead. |
| [log_slow_filter](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#log_slow_filter) | (all versions) | Having admin in log_slow_filter will add slow ANALYZE_TABLE statements to the slow log. |
| [sort_buffer_size](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sort_buffer_size) | (all versions) | For calculating the number of duplicates, ANALYZE TABLE uses a buffer of [sort_buffer_size](../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sort_buffer_size) bytes per column. You can slightly increase the speed of ANALYZE TABLE by increasing this variable. |



## Examples


```
-- update all engine-independent statistics for all columns and indexes
ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR ALL;

-- update specific columns and indexes:
ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR COLUMNS (col1,col2,...) INDEXES (idx1,idx2,...);

-- empty lists are allowed:
ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR COLUMNS (col1,col2,...) INDEXES ();
ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR COLUMNS () INDEXES (idx1,idx2,...);

-- the following will only update mysql.table_stats fields:
ANALYZE TABLE tbl PERSISTENT FOR COLUMNS () INDEXES ();

-- when use_stat_tables is set to 'COMPLEMENTARY' or 'PREFERABLY', 
-- a simple ANALYZE TABLE  collects engine-independent statistics for all columns and indexes.
SET SESSION use_stat_tables='COMPLEMENTARY';
ANALYZE TABLE tbl;
```
