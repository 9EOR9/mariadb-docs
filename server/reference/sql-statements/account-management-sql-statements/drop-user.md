# DROP USER

## Syntax

```sql
DROP USER [IF EXISTS] user_name [, user_name] ...
```

## Description

The `DROP USER` statement removes one or more MariaDB accounts. It removes privilege rows for the account from all grant tables. To use this statement, you must have the global [CREATE USER](grant.md#create-user) privilege\
or the [DELETE](grant.md#table-privileges) privilege for the mysql database. Each account is named using the same format as for the `CREATE USER`statement; for example, `'jeffrey'@'localhost'`. If you specify only the user name part of the account name, a host name part of `'%'` is used. For additional information about specifying account names, see [CREATE USER](create-user.md).

From [MariaDB 12.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/release-notes-mariadb-12.1-rolling-releases/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-12.1), by default, if you specify an account that is currently connected, it will not be deleted until the connection is closed. The connection will not automatically be closed. The statement will complete, and a warning, "Dropped users 'user'@'host\[,...]' have active connections. Use KILL CONNECTION if they should not be used anymore" issued.

In [Oracle mode](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/compatibility-and-differences/sql_modeoracle), if a user is connected, the DROP USER statement will fail with an error "Operation DROP USER failed for 'foo'@'localhost'".
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="<= 12.0" %}
If you specify an account that is currently connected, it will not be deleted until the connection is closed. The connection will not automatically be closed.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If any of the specified user accounts do not exist, `ERROR 1396 (HY000)`results. If an error occurs, `DROP USER` will still drop the accounts that do not result in an error. Only one error is produced for all users which have not been dropped:

```sql
ERROR 1396 (HY000): Operation DROP USER failed for 'u1'@'%','u2'@'%'
```

Failed `CREATE` or `DROP` operations, for both users and roles, produce the same error code.

#### IF EXISTS

If the `IF EXISTS` clause is used, MariaDB will return a note instead of an error if the user does not exist.

The `CREATE USER` statement creates new MariaDB accounts. To use it, you must have the global [CREATE USER](grant.md#create-user) privilege or the [INSERT](grant.md#table-privileges) privilege for the [mysql](../administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) database.



If any of the specified accounts, or any permissions f

## Examples

```sql
DROP USER bob;

DROP USER foo2@localhost,foo2@'127.%';
```

`IF EXISTS`:

```sql
DROP USER bob;
ERROR 1396 (HY000): Operation DROP USER failed for 'bob'@'%'

DROP USER IF EXISTS bob;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
