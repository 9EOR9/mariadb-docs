# EXPLAIN

## Syntax

```sql
EXPLAIN tbl_name [col_name | wild]
```

or

```sql
EXPLAIN [EXTENDED | PARTITIONS | FORMAT=JSON] 
  {SELECT select_options | UPDATE update_options | DELETE delete_options}
```

or

```sql
EXPLAIN [FORMAT=JSON] FOR CONNECTION <connection_id>
```

## Description

The `EXPLAIN` statement can be used either as a synonym for[DESCRIBE](../describe.md) or as a way to obtain information about how MariaDB executes a `SELECT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement:

* `'EXPLAIN tbl_name'` is synonymous with`'[DESCRIBE](../describe.md) tbl_name'` or`'[SHOW COLUMNS](../show/show-columns.md) FROM tbl_name'`.
* When you precede a `SELECT`, `UPDATE` or a `DELETE` statement with the keyword`EXPLAIN`, MariaDB displays information from the optimizer\
  about the query execution plan. That is, MariaDB explains how it would\
  process the `SELECT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, including information about how tables\
  are joined and in which order. `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` can be\
  used to provide additional information.
* `EXPLAIN PARTITIONS` is useful only when examining queries involving partitioned tables. For details, see [Partition pruning and selection](../../../../server-usage/partitioning-tables/partition-pruning-and-selection.md).
* [ANALYZE statement](analyze-statement.md) performs the query as well as producing EXPLAIN output, and provides actual as well as estimated statistics.
* `EXPLAIN` output can be printed in the [slow query log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/). See [EXPLAIN in the Slow Query Log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/explain-in-the-slow-query-log.md) for details.
* `EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION` is an alias for `SHOW EXPLAIN FOR`.

[SHOW EXPLAIN](../show/show-explain.md) shows the output of a running statement. In some cases, its output can be closer to reality than `EXPLAIN`.

The [ANALYZE statement](analyze-statement.md) runs a statement and returns information about its execution plan. It also shows additional columns, to check how much the optimizer's estimation about filtering and found rows are close to reality.

There is an online [EXPLAIN Analyzer](../../../../clients-and-utilities/analyzing-tools/explain-analyzer.md) that you can use to share `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` output with others.

`EXPLAIN` can acquire metadata locks in the same way that `SELECT` does, as it needs to know table metadata and, sometimes, data as well.

Here are descriptions of the values for some of the more complex columns in `EXPLAIN ... SELECT`:

#### "Select\_type" Column

The `select_type` column can have the following values:

| Value                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   | Comment                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### "Type" Column

This column contains information on how the table is accessed.

| Value            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ALL              | A full table scan is done for the table (all rows are read). This is bad if the table is large and the table is joined against a previous table! This happens when the optimizer could not find any usable index to access rows. |
| const            | There is only one possibly matching row in the table. The row is read before the optimization phase and all columns in the table are treated as constants.                                                                       |
| eq\_ref          | A unique index is used to find the rows. This is the best possible plan to find the row.                                                                                                                                         |
| filter           | A second index is being used with the [Rowid Filtering Optimization](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/rowid-filtering-optimization.md).                                                |
| fulltext         | A fulltext index is used to access the rows.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| index\_merge     | A 'range' access is done for for several index and the found rows are merged. The key column shows which keys are used.                                                                                                          |
| index\_subquery  | This is similar as ref, but used for sub queries that are transformed to key lookups.                                                                                                                                            |

#### "Extra" Column

This column consists of one or more of the following values, separated by ';'

_Note that some of these values are detected after the optimization phase._

The optimization phase can do the following changes to the `WHERE` clause:

* Add the expressions from the `ON` and `USING` clauses to the `WHERE`\
  clause.
* Constant propagation: If there is `column=constant`, replace all column\
  instances with this constant.
* Replace all columns from '`const`' tables with their values.
* Remove the used key columns from the `WHERE` (as this will be tested as\
  part of the key lookup).
* Remove impossible constant sub expressions.\
  For example `WHERE '(a=1 and a=2) OR b=1'` becomes `'b=1'`.
* Replace columns with other columns that has identical values:\
  Example: `WHERE` `a=b` and `a=c` may be treated\
  as `'WHERE a=b and a=c and b=c'`.
* Add extra conditions to detect impossible row conditions earlier. This\
  happens mainly with `OUTER JOIN` where we in some cases add detection\
  of `NULL` values in the `WHERE` (Part of '`Not exists`' optimization).\
  This can cause an unexpected '`Using where`' in the Extra column.
* For each table level we remove expressions that have already been tested when\
  we read the previous row. Example: When joining tables `t1` with `t2`\
  using the following `WHERE 't1.a=1 and t1.a=t2.b'`, we don't have to\
  test `'t1.a=1'` when checking rows in `t2` as we already know that this\
  expression is true.

| Impossible WHERE noticed after reading const tables. | The used WHERE clause is always false so the SELECT will return no rows. This case was detected after we had read all 'const' tables and used the column values as constant in the WHERE clause.

| no matching row in const table                       | The table was a const table (a table with only one possible matching row), but no row was found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| No tables used                                       | The SELECT was a sub query that did not use any tables.

This optimization is used with LEFT JOIN where one is explicitly searching for rows that doesn't exists in the LEFT JOIN TABLE. Example: SELECT \* FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 on (...) WHERE t2.not\_null\_column IS NULL. As t2.not\_null\_column can only be NULL if there was no matching row for on condition, we can stop searching if we find a single matching row.                               |

| Using filesort                                       | Filesort is needed to resolve the query. This means an extra phase where we first collect all columns to sort, sort them with a disk based merge sort and then use the sorted set to retrieve the rows in sorted order. If the column set is small, we store all the columns in the sort file to not have to go to the database to retrieve them again.                                                                                                              |
| Using index                                          | Only the index is used to retrieve the needed information from the table.

| Using index condition                                | Like 'Using where' but the where condition is pushed down to the table engine for internal optimization at the index level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Using index condition(BKA)                           | Like 'Using index condition' but in addition we use batch key access to retrieve rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Using index for group-by                             | The index is being used to resolve a GROUP BY or DISTINCT query. The rows are not read.

| Using temporary                                      | A temporary table is created to hold the result. This typically happens if you are using GROUP BY, DISTINCT or ORDER BY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Using where                                          | A WHERE expression (in additional to the possible key lookup) is used to check if the row should be accepted. If you don't have 'Using where' together with a join type of ALL, you are probably doing something wrong!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Using where with pushed condition                    | Like 'Using where' but the where condition is pushed down to the table engine for internal optimization at the row level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Using buffer                                         | The UPDATE statement will first buffer the rows, and then run the updates, rather than do updates on the fly. See [Using Buffer UPDATE Algorithm](using-buffer-update-algorithm.md) for a detailed explanation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### EXPLAIN EXTENDED

The `EXTENDED` keyword adds another column, _filtered_, to the output. This is a percentage estimate of the table rows that will be filtered by the condition.

An `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` will always throw a warning, as it adds extra _Message_ information to a subsequent `[SHOW WARNINGS](../show/show-warnings.md)` statement. This includes what the `SELECT` query would look like after optimizing and rewriting rules are applied and how the optimizer qualifies columns and tables.

## Examples

As synonym for `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW COLUMNS FROM`:

```
DESCRIBE city;
+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Id         | int(11)  | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| Name       | char(35) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| Country    | char(3)  | NO   | UNI |         |                |
| District   | char(20) | YES  | MUL |         |                |
| Population | int(11)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

A simple set of examples to see how `EXPLAIN` can identify poor index usage:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `employees_example` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(40) NOT NULL,

  `home_address` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `home_phone` varchar(12) NOT NULL,
  `employee_code` varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `employee_code` (`employee_code`),
  KEY `first_name` (`first_name`,`last_name`)
) ENGINE=Aria;

INSERT INTO `employees_example` (`first_name`, `last_name`, `position`, `home_address`, `home_phone`, `employee_code`)
  VALUES

  ('Lenina', 'Crowne', 'Cashier', '281 Bumblepuppy Boulevard', '328-555-2349', 'LC1'),
  ('Fanny', 'Crowne', 'Restocker', '1023 Bokanovsky Lane', '326-555-6329', 'FC1'),

SHOW INDEXES FROM employees_example;

`SELECT` on a primary key:

```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees_example WHERE id=1;
+------+-------------+-------------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+-------+------+-------+
| id   | select_type | table             | type  | possible_keys | key     | key_len | ref   | rows | Extra |
+------+-------------+-------------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+-------+------+-------+
|    1 | SIMPLE      | employees_example | const | PRIMARY       | PRIMARY | 4       | const |    1 |       |
+------+-------------+-------------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+-------+------+-------+
```

The type is _const_, which means that only one possible result could be returned.\
Now, returning the same record but searching by their phone number:

```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees_example WHERE home_phone='326-555-3492';
+------+-------------+-------------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
| id   | select_type | table             | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows | Extra       |
+------+-------------+-------------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
|    1 | SIMPLE      | employees_example | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL |    6 | Using where |
+------+-------------+-------------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
```

Here, the type is _All_, which means no index could be used. Looking at the rows count, a full table scan (all six rows) had to be performed in order to retrieve the record. If it's a requirement to search by phone number, an index will have to be created.

[SHOW EXPLAIN](../show/show-explain.md) example:

```
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR 1;

### Example of `ref_or_null` Optimization

```
SELECT * FROM table_name
  WHERE key_column=expr OR key_column IS NULL;
```

`ref_or_null` is something that often happens when you use subqueries with `NOT IN` as then one has to do an extra check for `NULL` values if the first value didn't have a matching row.
