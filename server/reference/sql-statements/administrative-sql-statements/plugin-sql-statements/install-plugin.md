# INSTALL PLUGIN

## Syntax

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN [IF NOT EXISTS] plugin_name SONAME 'plugin_library'
```

## Description

This statement installs an individual [plugin](../../../plugins/) from the specified library. To install the whole library (which could be required), use [INSTALL SONAME](install-soname.md). See also [Installing a Plugin](../../../plugins/plugin-overview.md#installing-a-plugin).

`plugin_name` is the name of the plugin as defined in theplugin declaration structure contained in the library file. Plugin names arenot case sensitive. For maximal compatibility, plugin names should be limitedto ASCII letters, digits, and underscore, because they are used in C sourcefiles, shell command lines, M4 and Bourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.

`plugin_library` is the name of the shared library thatcontains the plugin code. The file name extension can be omitted (which makes the statement look the same on all architectures).

The shared library must be located in the plugin directory (that is,the directory named by the [plugin\_dir](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#plugin_dir) system variable). The library must be in the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. Bydefault, `plugin_dir` is plugin directory under the directory named bythe `pkglibdir` configuration variable, but it can be changed by settingthe value of `plugin_dir` at server startup. For example, setits value in a `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mariadbd]
plugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory
```

If the value of [plugin\_dir](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#plugin_dir) is a relative path name, it istaken to be relative to the base directory (the value of the [basedir](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#basedir) system variable).

`INSTALL PLUGIN` adds a line to the `mysql.plugin` table thatdescribes the plugin. This table contains the plugin name and library filename.

`INSTALL PLUGIN` causes the server to readoption (`my.cnf`) files just as during server startup. This enables the plugin topick up any relevant options from those files. It is possible to add pluginoptions to an option file even before loading a plugin (if the loose prefix isused). It is also possible to uninstall a plugin, edit `my.cnf`, and install theplugin again. Restarting the plugin this way enables it to the new optionvalues without a server restart.

`INSTALL PLUGIN` also loads and initializes the plugin code tomake the plugin available for use. A plugin is initialized by executing itsinitialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must performbefore it can be used.

To use `INSTALL PLUGIN`, you must have the[INSERT privilege](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) for the `mysql.plugin` table.

At server startup, the server loads and initializes any plugin that islisted in the `mysql.plugin` table. This means that a plugin is installedwith `INSTALL PLUGIN` only once, not every time the serverstarts. Plugin loading at startup does not occur if the server is started withthe `--skip-grant-tables` option.

When the server shuts down, it executes the de-initialization functionfor each plugin that is loaded so that the plugin has a chance toperform any final cleanup.

If you need to load plugins for a single server startup when the`--skip-grant-tables` option is given (which tells the servernot to read system tables), use the`--plugin-load` [mariadbd option](../../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-plugin-load).

#### IF NOT EXISTS

When the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is used, MariaDB will return a note instead of an error if the specified plugin already exists. See [SHOW WARNINGS](../show/show-warnings.md).

## Examples

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN sphinx SONAME 'ha_sphinx.so';
```

The extension can also be omitted:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN innodb SONAME 'ha_xtradb';
```

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN IF NOT EXISTS example SONAME 'ha_example';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.104 sec)

INSTALL PLUGIN IF NOT EXISTS example SONAME 'ha_example';
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.000 sec)
