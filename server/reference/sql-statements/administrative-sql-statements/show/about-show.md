# About SHOW

`SHOW` provides information about various aspects of MariaDB Server. A list of the various `SHOW` statements is [here](./).

The general syntax is:

```sql
SHOW LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr
```

The `LIKE` and `WHERE` clauses make sense only for particular `SHOW` statements, though. See [Extended SHOW](extended-show.md) for what `SHOW` statements benefit from using those clauses.

If the syntax for a given `SHOW` statement includes `LIKE 'pattern'` , `'pattern'` is a\
string that can contain the SQL `%` and `_` wildcard characters. The pattern is useful for\
restricting statement output to matching values.
