# SHOW DATABASES

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW {DATABASES | SCHEMAS}
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

## Description

`SHOW DATABASES` lists the databases on the MariaDB server host.`SHOW SCHEMAS` is a synonym for`SHOW DATABASES`. The `LIKE` clause, if present on its own, indicates which database names to match. The `WHERE` and `LIKE` clauses can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in [Extended SHOW](extended-show.md).

You see only those databases for which you have some kind of privilege, unless you have the global [SHOW DATABASES privilege](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md). You can also get this list using the [mariadb-show](../../../../clients-and-utilities/administrative-tools/mariadb-show.md) command.

If the server was started with the `--skip-show-database` option, you cannot use this statement at all unless you have the [SHOW DATABASES privilege](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md).

The list of results returned by `SHOW DATABASES` is based on directories in the data directory, which is how MariaDB implements databases. It's possible that output includes directories that do not correspond to actual databases.

The [Information Schema SCHEMATA table](../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-schemata-table.md) also contains database information.

## Examples

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+
```

```sql
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'm%';
+---------------+
| Database (m%) |
+---------------+
| mysql         |
+---------------+
```
