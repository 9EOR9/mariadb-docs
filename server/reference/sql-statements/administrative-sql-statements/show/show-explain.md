# SHOW EXPLAIN

## Syntax

```
SHOW EXPLAIN [FORMAT=JSON] FOR <connection_id>;
EXPLAIN [FORMAT=JSON] FOR CONNECTION <connection_id>;
```

## Description

The `SHOW EXPLAIN` command allows one to get an [EXPLAIN](../analyze-and-explain-statements/explain.md) (that is, a\
description of a query plan) of a query running in a certain connection.

```
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR <connection_id>;
```

will produce an `EXPLAIN` output for the query that connection number `connection_id` is running. The connection id can be obtained with [SHOW PROCESSLIST](show-processlist.md).

```
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR 1;
+------+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+------+---------+-------------+
| id   | select_type | table | type  | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows    | Extra       |
+------+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+------+---------+-------------+
|    1 | SIMPLE      | tbl   | index | NULL          | a    | 5       | NULL | 1000107 | Using index |
+------+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+------+---------+-------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```

The output is always accompanied with a warning which shows the query the\
target connection is running (this shows what the `EXPLAIN` is for):

```
SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                |
+-------+------+------------------------+
| Note  | 1003 | select sum(a) from tbl |
+-------+------+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.9**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/what-is-mariadb-109)

The `EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION` syntax was added for MySQL compatibility.

### FORMAT=JSON

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.9**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/what-is-mariadb-109)

`SHOW EXPLAIN [FORMAT=JSON] FOR <connection_id>` extends `SHOW EXPLAIN` to return more detailed JSON output.

### Possible Errors

The output can be only produced if the target connection is _currently_ running a\
query, which has a ready query plan. If this is not the case, the output will\
be:

```
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR 2;
ERROR 1932 (HY000): Target is not running an EXPLAINable command
```

You will get this error when:

* the target connection is not running a command for which one can run `EXPLAIN`
* the target connection is running a command for which one can run `EXPLAIN`, but
  * there is no query plan yet (for example, tables are open and locks are\
    acquired before the query plan is produced)

### Differences Between SHOW EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN Outputs

#### Background

In MySQL, `EXPLAIN` execution takes a slightly different route from the way\
the real query (typically the `SELECT`) is optimized. This is unfortunate,\
and has caused a number of bugs in `EXPLAIN`. (For example, see[MDEV-326](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-326), [MDEV-410](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-410), and[lp:1013343](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maria/+bug/1013343).[lp:992942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maria/+bug/992942) is not directly\
about `EXPLAIN`, but it also would not have existed if MySQL didn't try to delete\
parts of a query plan in the middle of the query)

`SHOW EXPLAIN` examines a running `SELECT`, and hence its output may be\
slightly different from what `EXPLAIN SELECT` would produce. We did our best\
to make sure that either the difference is negligible, or `SHOW EXPLAIN`'s\
output is closer to reality than `EXPLAIN`'s output.

#### List of Recorded Differences

* `SHOW EXPLAIN` may have Extra='`no matching row in const table`', where `EXPLAIN` would produce Extra='`Impossible WHERE ...`'
* For queries with subqueries, `SHOW EXPLAIN` may print `select_type==PRIMARY` where regular `EXPLAIN` used to print `select_type==SIMPLE`, or vice versa.

#### Required Permissions

Running `SHOW EXPLAIN` requires the same permissions as running [SHOW PROCESSLIST](show-processlist.md) would.

## See Also

* [EXPLAIN](../analyze-and-explain-statements/explain.md)
* [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](../analyze-and-explain-statements/explain-analyze.md), which will perform a query and outputs enhanced `EXPLAIN` results.
* [SHOW ANALYZE](show-analyze.md)
* It is also possible to [save EXPLAIN into the slow query log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/explain-in-the-slow-query-log.md).
