# SHOW PRIVILEGES

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW PRIVILEGES
```

## Description

`SHOW PRIVILEGES` shows the list of [system privileges](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) that the MariaDB server supports. The exact list of privileges depends on the version of your server.

Note that before [MariaDB 10.3.23](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-10323-release-notes), [MariaDB 10.4.13](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/mariadb-10413-release-notes) and [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes) , the [Delete history](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges) privilege displays as `Delete versioning rows` ([MDEV-20382](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20382)).

## Example

From [MariaDB 10.5.9](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1059-release-notes)
