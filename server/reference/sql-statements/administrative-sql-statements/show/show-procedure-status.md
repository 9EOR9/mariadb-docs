# SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS

## Syntax

```
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

## Description

This statement is a MariaDB extension. It returns characteristics of a stored\
procedure, such as the database, name, type, creator, creation and modification\
dates, and character set information. A similar statement,`[SHOW FUNCTION STATUS](show-function-status.md)`, displays\
information about stored functions.

The `LIKE` clause, if present, indicates which procedure or\
function names to match. The `WHERE` and `LIKE` clauses can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in [Extended SHOW](extended-show.md).

The [ROUTINES table](../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-routines-table.md) in the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA database contains more detailed information.

## Examples

```
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS LIKE 'p1'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                  Db: test
                Name: p1
