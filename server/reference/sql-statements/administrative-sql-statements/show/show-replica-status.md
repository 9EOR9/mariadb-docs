# SHOW REPLICA STATUS

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW { REPLICA | SLAVE} ["connection_name"] STATUS [FOR CHANNEL "connection_name"]
```

or

```sql
SHOW ALL { REPLICAS | SLAVES } STATUS
```

## Description

This statement is to be run on a replica and provides status information on essential parameters of the [replica](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-overview.md) threads.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
This statement requires the [REPLICA MONITOR](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#replica-monitor) privilege.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 10.5.9" %}
This statement requires the [REPLICA MONITOR](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#replica-monitor) privilege.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 10.5.2" %}
This statement requires the [REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#binlog-monitor) privilege.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Multi-Source

The `ALL` and `"connection_name"` options allow you to connect to [many primaries at the same time](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/multi-source-replication.md).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
`ALL REPLICAS` gives you a list of all connections to the primary nodes.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 10.5.1" %}
`ALL SLAVES` gives you a list of all connections to the primary nodes.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The rows are sorted according to `Connection_name`.

If you specify a `connection_name`, you only get the information about that connection. If `connection_name` is not used, then the name set by `default_master_connection` is used. If the connection name doesn't exist you will get an error:`There is no master connection for 'xxx'`.

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.7.0**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-7-series/mariadb-1070-release-notes)

The `FOR CHANNEL` keyword was added for MySQL compatibility. This is identical to using the channel\_name directly after `SHOW SLAVE`.

### Column Descriptions

The order in which the columns appear depends on the MariaDB version. This means that extracting a column value is best done by comparing the field name instead of using a fixed offset into the row.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
These columns can also be viewed/extracted from the [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.SLAVE\_STATUS](../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-slave_status-table.md) table.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 11.6.0" %}
These columns cannot be viewed/extracted from the [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.SLAVE\_STATUS](../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-slave_status-table.md) table.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Replicate\_Wild\_Do\_Table:** Tables specified for replicating with the [replicate\_wild\_do\_table](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) option.

**Exec\_Master\_Log\_Pos:** Position up to which the SQL thread has processed in the current master [binary log](../../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) file. Can be used to start a new replica from a current replica with the [CHANGE MASTER TO ... MASTER\_LOG\_POS](../replication-statements/change-master-to.md) option.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
**Seconds\_Behind\_Master:** Difference between the timestamp logged on the master for the event that the replica is currently processing, and the current timestamp on the replica. Zero if the replica is not currently processing an event. With serial replication, seconds\_behind\_master is updated when the SQL thread begins executing a transaction. With [parallel replication](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/parallel-replication.md), seconds\_behind\_master is updated only after transactions commit. An exception is thrown on the parallel replica to additionally update `seconds_behind_master` when the first transaction received after idling is queued to a worker for execution, to provide a reliable initial value for the duration until a transaction commits.

Additional behavior to be aware of:

1. `Seconds_Behind_Master` will update for ignored events, e.g. those skipped due to [sql\_slave\_skip\_counter](../replication-statements/set-global-sql_slave_skip_counter.md).
2. On the serial replica, transactions with prior timestamps can update `Seconds_Behind_Master` such that it can go backwards, though this is not true for the parallel replica.
3. When configured with [MASTER\_DELAY](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/delayed-replication.md), as a replicated transaction begins executing (i.e. on a serial or post-idle parallel replica), `Seconds_Behind_Master` will update before delaying, and while delaying occurs will grow to encompass the configured value.
4. There is a known issue, tracked by [MDEV-17516](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17516), such that `Seconds_Behind_Master` will initially present as 0 on replica restart until a replicated transaction begins executing, even if the last replica session was lagging behind when stopped.

**Replicate\_Do\_Domain\_Ids:** List of [domain\_ids](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) that are currently being recognized for replication purposes, or an empty string for none, as specified in the `DO_DOMAIN_IDS` option of the [CHANGE MASTER TO](../replication-statements/change-master-to.md#do_domain_ids) statement.

**Replicate\_Ignore\_Domain\_Ids:** List of [domain\_ids](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) that are currently being ignored for replication purposes, or an empty string for none, as specified in the `IGNORE_DOMAIN_IDS` option of the [CHANGE MASTER TO](../replication-statements/change-master-to.md#ignore_domain_ids) statement.

If you issue this statement using the [mariadb](../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/) client, you can use a `\G` statement terminator rather than a semicolon to obtain a more readable vertical layout.
