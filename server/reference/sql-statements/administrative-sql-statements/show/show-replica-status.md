# SHOW REPLICA STATUS

## Syntax

```
SHOW { SLAVE | REPLICA } ["connection_name"] STATUS [FOR CHANNEL "connection_name"]
```

or

```
SHOW ALL { SLAVES | REPLICAS } STATUS
```

## Description

This statement is to be run on a replica and provides status information on essential parameters of the [replica](broken-reference) threads.

This statement requires the [SUPER](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege, the [REPLICATION\_CLIENT](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#replication-client) privilege, or, from [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), the [REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#binlog-monitor) privilege, or, from [MariaDB 10.5.9](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1059-release-notes), the [REPLICA MONITOR](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#replica-monitor) privilege.

### Multi-Source

The `ALL` and `"connection_name"` options allow you to connect to [many primaries at the same time](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/multi-source-replication.md).

`ALL SLAVES` (or `ALL REPLICAS` from [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes)) gives you a list of all connections to the primary nodes.

The rows will be sorted according to `Connection_name`.

If you specify a `connection_name`, you only get the information about that\
connection. If `connection_name` is not used, then the name set by `default_master_connection` is used. If the connection name doesn't exist you will get an error:`There is no master connection for 'xxx'`.

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.7.0**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-7-series/mariadb-1070-release-notes)

The `FOR CHANNEL` keyword was added for MySQL compatibility. This is identical to\
using the channel\_name directly after `SHOW SLAVE`.

### Column Descriptions

The order in which the columns appear depends on the MariaDB version. This means that extracting a column value is best done by comparing the field name instead of using a fixed offset into the row.

**MariaDB starting with** [**11.6.0**](../../../../../kb/en/mariadb-1160-release-notes/)

These columns can also be viewed/extracted from the `[INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SLAVE_STATUS](../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-slave_status-table.md)` table

| Seconds\_Behind\_Master           | Difference between the timestamp logged on the master for the event that the replica is currently processing, and the current timestamp on the replica. Zero if the replica is not currently processing an event. With serial replication, seconds\_behind\_master is updated when the SQL thread begins executing a transaction. With [parallel replication](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/parallel-replication.md), seconds\_behind\_master is updated only after transactions commit. Starting in MariaDB [10.5.19](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-10-5-19-release-notes), [10.6.12](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-10-6-12-release-notes), [10.8.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-8-series/mariadb-10-8-7-release-notes), [10.9.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/mariadb-10-9-5-release-notes), [10.10.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/mariadb-10-10-3-release-notes), and [10.11.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-2-release-notes), an exception is drawn on the parallel replica to additionally update seconds\_behind\_master when the first transaction received after idling is queued to a worker for execution, to provide a reliable initial value for the duration until a transaction commits. Additional behaviors to be aware of are as follows: 1) Seconds\_Behind\_Master will update for ignored events, e.g. those skipped due to [sql\_slave\_skip\_counter](../replication-statements/set-global-sql_slave_skip_counter.md). 2) On the serial replica, transactions with prior timestamps can update Seconds\_Behind\_Master such that it can go backwards, though this is not true for the parallel replica. 3) When configured with [MASTER\_DELAY](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/delayed-replication.md), as a replicated transaction begins executing (i.e. on a serial or post-idle parallel replica), Seconds\_Behind\_Master will update before delaying, and while delaying occurs will grow to encompass the configured value. 4) There is a known issue, tracked by [MDEV-17516](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17516), such that Seconds\_Behind\_Master will initially present as 0 on replica restart until a replicated transaction begins executing, even if the last replica session was lagging behind when stopped. |
