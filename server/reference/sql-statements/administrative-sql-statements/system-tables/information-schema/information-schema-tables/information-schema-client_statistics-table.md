# Information Schema CLIENT\_STATISTICS Table

The [Information Schema](../) `CLIENT_STATISTICS` table holds statistics about client connections. This is part of the [User Statistics](../../../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/user-statistics.md) feature, which is not enabled by default.

It contains the following columns:
