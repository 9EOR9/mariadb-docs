# Information Schema COLLATION\_CHARACTER\_SET\_APPLICABILITY Table

The [Information Schema](../) `COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY` table shows which [character sets](../../../../../data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) are associated with which collations.

It contains the following columns:

| Column                | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| COLLATION\_NAME       | Collation name.                                                    |
| CHARACTER\_SET\_NAME  | Name of the associated character set.                              |
| FULL\_COLLATION\_NAME | Name of the associated character set/collation combination.        |
| ID                    | The unique identifier of this character set/collation combination. |
| IS\_DEFAULT           | If the collation is the default for this character set.            |

The [COLLATIONS](information-schema-collations-table.md) table is table of the base `COLLATION_NAMES` in the same way that [CHARACTER\_SETS](information-schema-character_sets-table.md) table is table of the base `CHARACTER_SET_NAMES`. The `COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY` table is the mapping between collations and character sets.

When joining the [information\_schema.TABLES](information-schema-tables-table.md) table with its field `TABLE_COLLATIONS`, this should be joined to `FULL_COLLATION_NAME` in the `COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY` table.

See [Setting Character Sets and Collations](../../../../../data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/setting-character-sets-and-collations.md) for details on specifying the character set at the server, database, table and column levels.
