# Information Schema INNODB\_BUFFER\_POOL\_STATS Table

The [Information Schema](../../) `INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS` table contains information about pages in the [buffer pool](../../../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-buffer-pool.md), similar to what is returned with the `[SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS](../../../../show/show-engine-innodb-status.md)` statement.

The `PROCESS` [privilege](../../../../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) is required to view the table.

It has the following columns:
