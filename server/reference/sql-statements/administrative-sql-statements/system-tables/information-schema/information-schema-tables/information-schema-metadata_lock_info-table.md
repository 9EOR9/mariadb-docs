# Information Schema METADATA\_LOCK\_INFO Table

The [Information Schema](../) `METADATA_LOCK_INFO` table is created by the [metadata\_lock\_info](../../../../../plugins/other-plugins/metadata-lock-info-plugin.md) plugin. It shows active [metadata locks](../../../../transactions/metadata-locking.md) and user locks (the locks acquired with [GET\_LOCK](../../../../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/miscellaneous-functions/get_lock.md)).

## Description

It has the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| MDL\_INTENTION\_EXCLUSIVE    | An intention exclusive metadata lock (IX). Used only for scoped locks. Owner of this type of lock can acquire upgradable exclusive locks on individual objects. Compatible with other IX locks, but is incompatible with scoped S and X locks. IX lock is taken in SCHEMA namespace when we intend to modify object metadata. Object may refer table, stored procedure, trigger, view/etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| MDL\_SHARED                  | A shared metadata lock (S). To be used in cases when we are interested in object metadata only and there is no intention to access object data (e.g. for stored routines or during preparing prepared statements). We also mis-use this type of lock for open HANDLERs, since lock acquired by this statement has to be compatible with lock acquired by LOCK TABLES ... WRITE statement, i.e. SNRW (We can't get by acquiring S lock at HANDLER ... OPEN time and upgrading it to SR lock for HANDLER ... READ as it doesn't solve problem with need to abort DML statements which wait on table level lock while having open HANDLER in the same connection). To avoid deadlock which may occur when SNRW lock is being upgraded to X lock for table on which there is an active S lock which is owned by thread which waits in its turn for table-level lock owned by thread performing upgrade we have to use thr\_abort\_locks\_for\_thread() facility in such situation. This problem does not arise for locks on stored routines as we don't use SNRW locks for them. It also does not arise when S locks are used during PREPARE calls as table-level locks are not acquired in this case. This lock is taken for global read lock, when caching a stored procedure in memory for the duration of the transaction and for tables used by prepared statements. |
| MDL\_SHARED\_HIGH\_PRIO      | A high priority shared metadata lock. Used for cases when there is no intention to access object data (i.e. data in the table). "High priority" means that, unlike other shared locks, it is granted ignoring pending requests for exclusive locks. Intended for use in cases when we only need to access metadata and not data, e.g. when filling an INFORMATION\_SCHEMA table. Since SH lock is compatible with SNRW lock, the connection that holds SH lock should not try to acquire any kind of table-level or row-level lock, as this can lead to a deadlock. Moreover, after acquiring SH lock, the connection should not wait for any other resource, as it might cause starvation for X locks and a potential deadlock during upgrade of SNW or SNRW to X lock (e.g. if the upgrading connection holds the resource that is being waited for).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| MDL\_SHARED\_READ            | A shared metadata lock (SR) for cases when there is an intention to read data from table. A connection holding this kind of lock can read table metadata and read table data (after acquiring appropriate table and row-level locks). This means that one can only acquire TL\_READ, TL\_READ\_NO\_INSERT, and similar table-level locks on table if one holds SR MDL lock on it. To be used for tables in SELECTs, subqueries, and LOCK TABLE ... READ statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| MDL\_SHARED\_WRITE           | A shared metadata lock (SW) for cases when there is an intention to modify (and not just read) data in the table. A connection holding SW lock can read table metadata and modify or read table data (after acquiring appropriate table and row-level locks). To be used for tables to be modified by INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements, but not LOCK TABLE ... WRITE or DDL). Also taken by SELECT ...

| MDL\_SHARED\_NO\_WRITE       | An upgradable shared metadata lock which blocks all attempts to update table data, allowing reads. A connection holding this kind of lock can read table metadata and read table data. Can be upgraded to X metadata lock. Note, that since this type of lock is not compatible with SNRW or SW lock types, acquiring appropriate engine-level locks for reading (TL\_READ\* for MyISAM, shared row locks in InnoDB) should be contention-free. To be used for the first phase of ALTER TABLE, when copying data between tables, to allow concurrent SELECTs from the table, but not UPDATEs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| MDL\_SHARED\_NO\_READ\_WRITE | An upgradable shared metadata lock which allows other connections to access table metadata, but not data.
