# Information Schema PROCESSLIST Table

The [Information Schema](../) `PROCESSLIST` table contains information about running threads.

Similar information can also be returned with the [SHOW \[FULL\] PROCESSLIST](../../../show/show-processlist.md) statement, or the [mariadb-admin processlist](../../../../../../clients-and-utilities/administrative-tools/mariadb-admin.md) command.

It contains the following columns:

Note that as a difference to MySQL, in MariaDB the `TIME`\
column (and also the `TIME_MS` column) are not affected by\
any setting of `[@TIMESTAMP](../../../../../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#timestamp)`. This means that it can be\
reliably used also for threads that change `@TIMESTAMP` (such\
as the [replication](broken-reference) SQL thread). See also [MySQL Bug #22047](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=22047).

As a consequence of this, the `TIME` column of`SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST` and`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST` can not be used to determine\
if a slave is lagging behind. For this, use instead the`Seconds_Behind_Master` column in the output of[SHOW SLAVE STATUS](../../../show/show-replica-status.md).

Note that the `PROGRESS` field from the information schema, and the `PROGRESS` field from `SHOW PROCESSLIST` display different results. `SHOW PROCESSLIST` shows the total progress, while the information schema shows the progress for the current stage only.. To retrieve a similar "total" Progress value from `information_schema.PROCESSLIST` as the one from `SHOW PROCESSLIST`, use

```
SELECT CASE WHEN Max_Stage < 2 THEN Progress ELSE (Stage-1)/Max_Stage*100+Progress/Max_Stage END 
  AS Progress FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST;
```
