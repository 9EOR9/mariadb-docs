# Information Schema SEQUENCES Table

**MariaDB starting with** [**11.5**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115)

The [Information Schema](../) `SEQUENCES` table stores information about [sequences](../../../../../sql-structure/sequences/) on the server.

It contains the following columns. See [CREATE SEQUENCE](../../../../../sql-structure/sequences/create-sequence.md) for details.

| Column                    | Description                                       |

| SEQUENCE\_CATALOG         | Catalog name                                      |
| SEQUENCE\_SCHEMA          | Database name                                     |
| SEQUENCE\_NAME            | Sequence name                                     |
| DATA\_TYPE                | Data type, for example BIGINT or TINYINT UNSIGNED |
| NUMERIC\_PRECISION        |                                                   |
| NUMERIC\_PRECISION\_RADIX |                                                   |
| NUMERIC\_SCALE            |                                                   |
| START\_VALUE              |                                                   |
| MINIMUM\_VALUE            |                                                   |

| CYCLE\_OPTION             | 1 if the CYCLE OPTION is set, otherwise 0         |

## Example

```
CREATE SEQUENCE s START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEQUENCES\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       SEQUENCE_CATALOG: def
        SEQUENCE_SCHEMA: test
          SEQUENCE_NAME: s
              DATA_TYPE: bigint
      NUMERIC_PRECISION: 64
NUMERIC_PRECISION_RADIX: 2
          NUMERIC_SCALE: 0
            START_VALUE: 100
          MINIMUM_VALUE: 1
          MAXIMUM_VALUE: 9223372036854775806
              INCREMENT: 10
           CYCLE_OPTION: 0
