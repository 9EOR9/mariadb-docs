Queries to the `TRIGGERS` table will return information only for databases and tables for which you have the `TRIGGER` [privilege](../../../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges). Similar information is returned by the [SHOW TRIGGERS](../../../show/show-triggers.md) statement.
