**MariaDB** [**5.5.27**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5527-release-notes) **-** [**10.0**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0)

The `INNODB_UNDO_LOGS` are a Percona enhancement, introduced in version [MariaDB 5.5.27](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5527-release-notes) and removed in 10.0.

The [Information Schema](../../) `INNODB_UNDO_LOGS` table is a Percona enchancement, and is only available for XtraDB, not InnoDB (see [XtraDB and InnoDB](../../../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/)). It contains information about the InnoDB [undo log](../../../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-undo-log.md), with each record being an undo log segment. It was removed in [MariaDB 10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0).

It has the following columns:
