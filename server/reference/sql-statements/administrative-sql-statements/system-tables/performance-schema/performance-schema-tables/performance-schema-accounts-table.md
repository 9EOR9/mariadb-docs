# Performance Schema accounts Table

## Description

Each account that connects to the server is stored as a row in the accounts table, along with current and total connections.

The table size is determined at startup by the value of the [performance\_schema\_accounts\_size](../performance-schema-system-variables.md#performance_schema_accounts_size) system variable. If this is set to 0, account statistics will be disabled.

| Column               | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| USER                 | The connection's client user name for the connection, or NULL if an internal thread. |
| HOST                 | The connection client's host name, or NULL if an internal thread.                    |
| CURRENT\_CONNECTIONS | Current connections for the account.                                                 |
| TOTAL\_CONNECTIONS   | Total connections for the account.                                                   |

The `USER` and `HOST` values shown here are the username and host used for user connections, not the patterns used to check permissions.

## Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.accounts;
+------------------+-----------+---------------------+-------------------+
| USER             | HOST      | CURRENT_CONNECTIONS | TOTAL_CONNECTIONS |
