**MariaDB starting with** [**10.5.2**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)

The `events_statements_summary_by_program` table, along with many other new [Performance Schema tables](list-of-performance-schema-tables.md), was added in [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes).

Each row in the [Performance Schema](../) events\_statements\_summary\_by\_program table summarizes events for a particular stored program (stored procedure, stored function, trigger or event).

It contains the following fields.
