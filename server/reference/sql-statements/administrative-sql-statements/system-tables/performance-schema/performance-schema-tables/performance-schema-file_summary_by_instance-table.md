# Performance Schema file\_summary\_by\_instance Table

The [Performance Schema](../) `file_summary_by_instance` table contains file events summarized by instance. It contains the following columns:

I/O operations can be avoided by caching, in which case they will not be recorded in this table.

You can [TRUNCATE](../../../../table-statements/truncate-table.md) the table, which will reset all counters to zero.
