# Performance Schema host\_cache Table

The `host_cache` table contains host and IP information from the host\_cache, used for avoiding DNS lookups for new client connections.

The host\_cache table contains the following columns:

| Column                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
