{% endhint %}

There are five memory summary tables in the Performance Schema that share a number of fields in common. These include:

* [memory\_summary\_by\_account\_by\_event\_name](performance-schema-memory_summary_by_account_by_event_name-table.md)
* memory\_summary\_by\_host\_by\_event\_name
* [memory\_summary\_by\_thread\_by\_event\_name](performance-schema-memory_summary_by_thread_by_event_name-table.md)
* [memory\_summary\_by\_user\_by\_event\_name](performance-schema-memory_summary_by_user_by_event_name-table.md)
* [memory\_global\_by\_event\_name](performance-schema-memory_summary_global_by_event_name-table.md)

The `memory_summary_by_host_by_event_name` table contains memory usage statistics aggregated by host and event.

The table contains the following columns:

| Field                            | Type                | Null | Default | Description                                                                           |

| LOW\_COUNT\_USED                 | bigint(20)          | NO   | NULL    | Lowest number of allocated blocks (lowest value of CURRENT\_COUNT\_USED).             |
| CURRENT\_COUNT\_USED             | bigint(20)          | NO   | NULL    | Currently allocated blocks that have not been freed (COUNT\_ALLOC minus COUNT\_FREE). |
