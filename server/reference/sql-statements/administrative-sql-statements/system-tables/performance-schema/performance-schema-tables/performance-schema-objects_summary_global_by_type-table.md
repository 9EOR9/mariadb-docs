# Performance Schema objects\_summary\_global\_by\_type Table

It aggregates object wait events, and contains the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OBJECT\_TYPE     | Groups records together with OBJECT\_SCHEMA and OBJECT\_NAME. |
| OBJECT\_SCHEMA   | Groups records together with OBJECT\_TYPE and OBJECT\_NAME.   |
| OBJECT\_NAME     | Groups records together with OBJECT\_SCHEMA and OBJECT\_TYPE. |
| COUNT\_STAR      | Number of summarized events                                   |
| SUM\_TIMER\_WAIT | Total wait time of the summarized events that are timed.      |
| MIN\_TIMER\_WAIT | Minimum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.    |
| AVG\_TIMER\_WAIT | Average wait time of the summarized events that are timed.    |
| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT | Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.    |

You can [TRUNCATE](../../../../table-statements/truncate-table.md) the table, which will reset all counters to zero.
