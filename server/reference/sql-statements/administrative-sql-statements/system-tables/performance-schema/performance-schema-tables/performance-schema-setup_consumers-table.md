# Performance Schema setup_consumers Table

Lists the types of consumers for which event information is available.


The `setup_consumers` table contains the following columns:



| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NAME | Consumer name |
| ENABLED | YES or NO for whether or not the consumer is enabled. You can modify this column to ensure that event information is added, or is not added. |



The table can be modified directly, or the server started with the option enabled, for example:


```
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history=ON
```

## Example


```
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers;

+--------------------------------+---------+
