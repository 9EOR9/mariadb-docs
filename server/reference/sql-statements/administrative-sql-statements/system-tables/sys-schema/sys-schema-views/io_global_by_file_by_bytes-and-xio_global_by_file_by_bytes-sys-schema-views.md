# io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_bytes and x$io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_bytes Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `io_global_by_file_by_bytes` and `x$io_global_by_file_by_bytes` views summarize global I/O consumers showing I/O in bytes, grouped by file. Rows are sorted by descending total I/O (bytes read and written) by default.

The `io_global_by_file_by_bytes` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$io_global_by_file_by_bytes` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| file           | File path name.                                      |
| count\_read    | Total number of read events for the file.            |
| total\_read    | Total number of bytes read from the file.            |
| avg\_read      | Average number of bytes per read from the file.      |
| count\_write   | Total number of write events for the file.           |
| total\_written | Total number of bytes written to the file.           |
| avg\_write     | Average number of bytes per write to the file.       |
| total          | Total number of bytes read and written for the file. |
| write\_pct     | Percentage of total I/O bytes that were writes.      |
