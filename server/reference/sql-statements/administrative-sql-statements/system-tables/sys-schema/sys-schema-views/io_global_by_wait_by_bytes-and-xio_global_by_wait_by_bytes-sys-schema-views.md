# io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_bytes and x$io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_bytes Sys Schema Views

**MariaDB starting with** [**10.6**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)

These [Sys Schema](../) views were introduced in [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106).

## Description

The `io_global_by_wait_by_bytes` and `x$io_global_by_wait_by_bytes` views summarize global I/O consumers, displaying amount of I/O and time waiting for I/O, grouped by event. Rows are sorted by descending total I/O (bytes read and written) by default.

The `io_global_by_wait_by_bytes` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$io_global_by_wait_by_bytes` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Column           | Description                                                     |
| event\_name      | I/O event name. The wait/io/file prefix is stripped.            |
| total            | Total number of occurrences of the I/O event.                   |
| total\_latency   | Total wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event           |
| min\_latency     | Minimum single wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event. |
| avg\_latency     | Average wait time per timed occurrence of the I/O event.        |
| max\_latency     | Maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event. |
| count\_read      | Total number of read I/O events for the file.                   |
| total\_read      | Total number of bytes read for the I/O event.                   |
| avg\_read        | Average number of bytes per read for the I/O event.             |
| count\_write     | Total number of write requests for the I/O event.               |
| total\_written   | Number of bytes written for the I/O event.                      |
| avg\_written     | Average number of bytes per write for the I/O event.            |
| total\_requested | Total number of bytes (read and write) for the I/O event.       |
