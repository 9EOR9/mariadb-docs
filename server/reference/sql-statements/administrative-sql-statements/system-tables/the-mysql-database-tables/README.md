# The mysql Database Tables

MariaDB comes pre-installed with a system database called `mysql` containing many important tables storing, in particular, [grant and privilege](../../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) information. Before [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/what-is-mariadb-104), system tables used the [MyISAM](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) storage engine. From [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/what-is-mariadb-104), they use [Aria](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/).
