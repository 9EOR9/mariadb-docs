# The mysql Database Tables

MariaDB comes pre-installed with a system database called `mysql` containing many important tables storing, in particular, [grant and privilege](../../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) information. Before MariaDB 10.4, system tables used the [MyISAM](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) storage engine. From MariaDB 10.4, they use [Aria](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/).
