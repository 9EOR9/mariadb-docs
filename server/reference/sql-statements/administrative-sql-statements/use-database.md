# USE \[DATABASE]

## Syntax

```sql
USE db_name
```

From [MariaDB 11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117), one can also use

```sql
USE DATABASE db_name;
```

## Description

The `'USE db_name'` statement tells MariaDB to use the`db_name` database as the default (current) database forsubsequent statements. The database remains the default until the end of thesession or another `USE` statement is issued:

```sql
USE db1;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;   # selects from db1.mytable
USE db2;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;   # selects from db2.mytable
```

The [DATABASE()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/database.md) function ([SCHEMA()](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/schema.md) is a synonym) returns the default database.

Another way to set the default database is specifying its name at [mariadb](../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/mariadb-command-line-client.md) command line client startup.

One cannot use `USE DATABASE` to a database one has no privileges to. The reason is thata user with no privileges to a database should not be able to know if a database exists or not.
