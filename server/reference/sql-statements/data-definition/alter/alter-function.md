# ALTER FUNCTION

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER FUNCTION func_name [characteristic ...]

characteristic:
    { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }
  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }
  | COMMENT 'string'
```

## Description

This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a stored function. More than one change may be specified in an `ALTER FUNCTION` statement. However, you cannot change the parameters or body of a stored function using this statement; to make such changes, you must drop and re-create the function using [DROP FUNCTION](../../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-functions/drop-function.md) and [CREATE FUNCTION](../create/create-function.md).

You must have the `ALTER ROUTINE` privilege for the function. (That privilege is granted automatically to the function creator.) If binary logging is enabled, the `ALTER FUNCTION` statement might also require\
the `SUPER` privilege, as described in [Binary Logging of Stored Routines](../../../../server-usage/stored-routines/binary-logging-of-stored-routines.md).

## Example

```sql
ALTER FUNCTION hello SQL SECURITY INVOKER;
```
