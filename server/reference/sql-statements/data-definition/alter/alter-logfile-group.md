# ALTER LOGFILE GROUP

## Syntax


```
ALTER LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    ADD UNDOFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]

```

The `ALTER LOGFILE GROUP` statement is not supported by MariaDB. It was originally inherited from MySQL NDB Cluster. See [MDEV-19295](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19295) for more information.
