# ALTER TABLESPACE

The `ALTER TABLESPACE` statement is not supported by MariaDB. It was originally inherited from MySQL NDB Cluster. In MySQL 5.7 and later, the statement is also supported for InnoDB. However, MariaDB has chosen not to include that specific feature. See [MDEV-19294](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19294) for more information.
