# SELECT ... OFFSET ... FETCH

{% hint style="info" %}
`SELECT ... OFFSET ... FETCH` is available from [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106).
{% endhint %}

## Syntax

```sql
OFFSET start { ROW | ROWS }
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } { ONLY | WITH TIES }
```

## Description

The `OFFSET` clause allows one to return only those elements of a resultset that come after a specified offset. The `FETCH` clause specifies the number of rows to return, while `ONLY` or `WITH TIES` specifies whether or not to also return any further results that tie for last place according to the ordered resultset.

Either the singular `ROW` or the plural `ROWS` can be used after the `OFFSET` and `FETCH` clauses; the choice has no impact on the results.

`FIRST` and `NEXT` give the same result.

In the case of `WITH TIES`, an [ORDER BY](order-by.md) clause is required, otherwise an error will be returned.

```sql
SELECT i FROM t1 FETCH FIRST 2 ROWS WITH TIES;
ERROR 4180 (HY000): FETCH ... WITH TIES requires ORDER BY clause to be present
```

## Examples

Given a table with 6 rows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t1 (i INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4), (4), (5);
SELECT i FROM t1 ORDER BY i ASC;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
```

`OFFSET 2` allows one to skip the first two results:

```sql
SELECT i FROM t1 ORDER BY i ASC OFFSET 2 ROWS;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
```

`FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY` limits the results to three rows only:

```sql
SELECT i FROM t1 ORDER BY i ASC OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
+------+
```

The same outcome can also be achieved with the [LIMIT](limit.md) clause:

```sql
SELECT i FROM t1 ORDER BY i ASC LIMIT 3 OFFSET 1;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
+------+
```

`WITH TIES` ensures the tied result `4` is also returned:

```sql
SELECT i FROM t1 ORDER BY i ASC OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS WITH TIES;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    4 |
+------+
```
