# OVERLAPS

## Syntax

```sql
OVERLAPS(g1,g2)
```

## Description

Returns `1` or `0` to indicate whether `g1` spatially overlaps `g2`.\
The term spatially overlaps is used if two geometries of equal dimensions intersect and their intersection results in a geometry of the same dimension but not equal to either of the given geometries.

`OVERLAPS()` is based on the original MySQL implementation and uses object bounding rectangles, while [ST\_OVERLAPS()](st-overlaps.md) uses object shapes.
