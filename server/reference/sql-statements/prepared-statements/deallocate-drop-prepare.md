# DEALLOCATE / DROP PREPARE

## Syntax

```sql
{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name
```

## Description

To deallocate a prepared statement produced with [PREPARE](prepare-statement.md), use a`DEALLOCATE PREPARE` statement that refers to the prepared statement name.

A prepared statement is implicitly deallocated when a new `PREPARE` command is issued. In that case, there is no need to use `DEALLOCATE`.

Attempting to execute a prepared statement after deallocating it results in an error, as if it was not prepared at all:

```sql
ERROR 1243 (HY000): Unknown prepared statement handler (stmt_name) given to EXECUTE
```

If the specified statement has not been PREPAREd, an error similar to the following will be produced:

```sql
ERROR 1243 (HY000): Unknown prepared statement handler (stmt_name) given to DEALLOCATE PREPARE
```

## Example

See [example in PREPARE](prepare-statement.md#example).
