# CASE Statement

## Syntax

```sql
CASE case_value
    WHEN when_value THEN statement_list
    [WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE
```

Or:

```sql
CASE
    WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list
    [WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list] 
END CASE
```

## Description

The text on this page describes the `CASE` statement for [stored programs](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/). See the [CASE OPERATOR](../../sql-functions/control-flow-functions/case-operator.md) for details on the CASE operator outside of [stored programs](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/).

The `CASE` statement for [stored programs](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/) implements a complex conditional construct. If a `search_condition` evaluates to true, the corresponding SQL statement list is executed. If no search condition matches, the statement list in the `ELSE` clause is executed. Each `statement_list` consists of one or more statements.

The `CASE` statement cannot have an `ELSE NULL` clause, and it is terminated with `END CASE` instead of `END`. implements a complex conditional construct. If a `search_condition` evaluates to true, the corresponding SQL statement list is executed. If no search condition matches, the statement list in the `ELSE` clause is executed. Each `statement_list` consists of one or more statements.

If no when\_value or search\_condition matches the value tested and the `CASE` statement contains no `ELSE` clause, a Case not found for `CASE` statement error results.

Each statement\_list consists of one or more statements; an empty`statement_list` is not allowed. To handle situations where no value is matched by any `WHEN` clause, use an `ELSE` containing an empty [BEGIN ... END](begin-end.md) block, as shown in this example:

```sql
DELIMITER |
CREATE PROCEDURE p()
BEGIN
  DECLARE v INT DEFAULT 1;
  CASE v
    WHEN 2 THEN SELECT v;
    WHEN 3 THEN SELECT 0;
    ELSE BEGIN END;
  END CASE;
END;
|
```

The indentation used here in the `ELSE` clause is for purposes of clarity only, and is not otherwise significant. See [Delimiters in the mariadb client](broken-reference) for more on the use of the delimiter command.

**Note:** The syntax of the `CASE` statement used inside stored programs differs slightly from that of the SQL CASE expression described in[CASE OPERATOR](../../sql-functions/control-flow-functions/case-operator.md). The `CASE` statement cannot have an `ELSE NULL` clause, and it is terminated with `END CASE` instead of `END`.
