# LOOP

## Syntax

```sql
[begin_label:] LOOP
    statement_list
END LOOP [end_label]
```

## Description

`LOOP` implements a simple loop construct, enabling repeated execution of the statement list, which consists of one or more statements, each terminated by a semicolon (i.e., `;`) statement delimiter. The statements within the loop are repeated until the loop is exited; usually this is accomplished with a [LEAVE](leave.md) statement.

A `LOOP` statement can be [labeled](labels.md). `end_label` cannot be given unless`begin_label` also is present. If both are present, they must be the same.

See [Delimiters](../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/delimiters.md) in the [mariadb](../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/) client for more on delimiter usage in the client.
