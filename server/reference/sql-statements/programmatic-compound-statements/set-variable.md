# SET Variable

## Syntax

```sql
SET var_name = expr [, var_name = expr] ...
```

## Description

The `SET` statement in [stored programs](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/) is an extended version of the general [SET](../administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/) statement. Referenced variables may be ones declared inside a stored program, global system variables, or user-defined variables.

The `SET` statement in stored programs is implemented as part of the pre-existing [SET](../administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md) syntax. This allows an extended syntax of `SET a=x, b=y, ...` where different variable types (locally declared variables, global and session server variables, user-defined variables) can be mixed. This also allows combinations of local variables and some options that make sense only for system variables; in that case, the options are recognized but ignored.

`SET` can be used with both [local variables](declare-variable.md) and [user-defined variables](../../sql-structure/sql-language-structure/user-defined-variables.md).

When setting several variables using the columns returned by a query, [SELECT INTO](selectinto.md) should be preferred.

To set many variables to the same value, the [LAST\_VALUE( )](../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_value.md) function can be used.

Below is an example of how a user-defined variable may be set:

```sql
SET @x = 1;
```
