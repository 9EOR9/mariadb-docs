# Replication Statements

The terms "master" and "slave" have historically been used in the context of replication. MariaDB is transitioning to the use of "primary" and "replica" as synonyms. The original terms will remain in use to ensure backward compatibility. For ongoing updates on this initiative, refer to [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777).

Additionally, there is a list of replication-related statements available. For further details on replication, see the relevant section on replication.
