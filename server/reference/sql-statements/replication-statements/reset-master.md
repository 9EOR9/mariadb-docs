# RESET MASTER

```
RESET MASTER [TO #]
```

Deletes all [binary log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) files listed in the index file, resets the\
binary log index file to be empty, and creates a new binary log file with a suffix of .000001.

If `TO #` is given, then the first new binary log file will start from number #.

This statement is for use only when the master is started for the first time, and should never be used if any slaves are actively [replicating](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/server/reference/sql-statements/replication-statements/broken-reference/README.md) from the binary log.

* The [PURGE BINARY LOGS](../administrative-sql-statements/purge-binary-logs.md) statement is intended for use in active replication.
