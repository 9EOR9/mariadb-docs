# RESTORE TABLE (removed)

RESTORE TABLE was removed and is no longer a part of MariaDB.

## Syntax

```
RESTORE TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... FROM '/path/to/backup/directory'
```

## Description

#### Note:

Like [BACKUP TABLE](backup-table-removed.md), this command was not reliable and has been removed in current versions of MariaDB. For doing a backup of MariaDB use [mysqldump](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mysqldump.md), [mysqlhotcopy](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mysqlhotcopy.md) or [XtraBackup](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/backing-up-and-restoring-databases-percona-xtrabackup/percona-xtrabackup-overview.md). See [Backing Up and Restoring](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/server/reference/sql-statements/table-statements/obsolete-table-commands/broken-reference/README.md).

`RESTORE TABLE` restores the table or tables from a backup\
that was made with `[BACKUP TABLE](backup-table-removed.md)`. The\
directory should be specified as a full path name.

Existing tables are not overwritten; if you try to restore over an existing\
table, an error occurs. Just as for `BACKUP TABLE`,`RESTORE TABLE` works only for [MyISAM](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables.\
Restored tables are not replicated from master to slave.

The backup for each table consists of its .frm format file and .MYD\
data file. The restore operation restores those files, and then uses\
them to rebuild the .MYI index file. Restoring takes longer than\
backing up due to the need to rebuild the indexes. The more indexes the\
table has, the longer it takes.
