# Transaction Timeouts

MariaDB has always had the [wait\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#wait_timeout) and [interactive\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#interactive_timeout) settings, which close connections after a certain period of inactivity.

However, these are by default set to a long wait period. In situations where transactions may be started, but not committed or rolled back, more granular control and a shorter timeout may be desirable so as to avoid locks being held for too long.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
These variables help handle this situation:

* [idle\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_transaction_timeout) (all transactions)
* [idle\_write\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_write_transaction_timeout) (write transactions)
* [idle\_readonly\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_readonly_transaction_timeout) (read transactions)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 10.3" %}
There is no variables for more granular control.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

These accept a time in seconds to time out, by closing the connection, transactions that are idle for longer than this period. By default all are set to zero, or no timeout.

[idle\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_transaction_timeout) affects all transactions, [idle\_write\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_write_transaction_timeout) affects write transactions only and [idle\_readonly\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_readonly_transaction_timeout) affects read transactions only. The latter two variables work independently. However, if either is set along with [idle\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_transaction_timeout), the settings for [idle\_write\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_write_transaction_timeout) or [idle\_readonly\_transaction\_timeout](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#idle_readonly_transaction_timeout) will take precedence.

## Examples

```sql
SET SESSION idle_transaction_timeout=2;
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM t;
Empty set (0.000 sec)
## wait 3 seconds
SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away
```

```sql
SET SESSION idle_write_transaction_timeout=2;
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM t;
Empty set (0.000 sec)
## wait 3 seconds
SELECT * FROM t;
Empty set (0.000 sec)
INSERT INTO t VALUES(1);
## wait 3 seconds
SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away
```

```sql
SET SESSION idle_transaction_timeout=2, SESSION idle_readonly_transaction_timeout=10;
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM t;
Empty set (0.000 sec)
 ## wait 3 seconds
SELECT * FROM t;
Empty set (0.000 sec)
## wait 11 seconds
SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away
```
