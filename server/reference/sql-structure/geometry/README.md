# Geographic & Geometric Features

MariaDB supports spatial extensions that enable the creation, storage and analysis of geographic features. These can be used in the [Aria](../../storage-engines/aria/README.md), [MyISAM](../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/README.md), [InnoDB/XtraDB](../../storage-engines/innodb/README.md) and [ARCHIVE](../../storage-engines/archive/README.md) engines in MariaDB.


[Partitioned tables](../../../server-management/partitioning-tables/README.md) do not support geometric types.
