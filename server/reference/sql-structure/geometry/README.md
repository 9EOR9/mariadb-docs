# Geometry

MariaDB supports spatial extensions that enable the creation, storage and analysis of geographic features. These can be used in the [Aria](../../storage-engines/aria/), [MyISAM](../../storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/), [InnoDB/XtraDB](../../storage-engines/innodb/) and [ARCHIVE](../../storage-engines/archive/) engines in MariaDB.

[Partitioned tables](../../../server-management/partitioning-tables/) do not support geometric types.
