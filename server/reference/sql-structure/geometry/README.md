# Geometry

MariaDB supports spatial extensions that enable the creation, storage and analysis of geographic features. These can be used in the [Aria](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/), [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/), [InnoDB/XtraDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) and [ARCHIVE](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/archive/) engines in MariaDB.

[Partitioned tables](../../../server-usage/partitioning-tables/) do not support geometric types.
