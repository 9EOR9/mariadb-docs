# CROSSES

## Syntax

```sql
Crosses(g1,g2)
```

## Description

Returns `1` if `g1` spatially crosses `g2`. Returns `NULL` if `g1` is\
a [Polygon](../../../sql-statements/geometry-constructors/geometry-constructors/polygon.md) or a [MultiPolygon](../../../sql-statements/geometry-constructors/geometry-constructors/multipolygon.md), or if `g2` is a[Point](../../../sql-statements/geometry-constructors/geometry-constructors/point.md) or a [MultiPoint](../../../sql-statements/geometry-constructors/geometry-constructors/multipoint.md). Otherwise, returns `0`.

The term spatially crosses denotes a spatial relation between two\
given geometries that has the following properties:

* The two geometries intersect
* Their intersection results in a geometry that has a dimension that is one\
  less than the maximum dimension of the two given geometries
* Their intersection is not equal to either of the two given geometries

CROSSES() is based on the original MySQL implementation, and uses object bounding rectangles, while [ST\_CROSSES()](st-crosses.md) uses object shapes.
