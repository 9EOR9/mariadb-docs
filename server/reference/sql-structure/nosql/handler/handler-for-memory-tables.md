# HANDLER for MEMORY Tables

This article explains how to use [HANDLER commands](handler-commands.md) efficiently with [MEMORY/HEAP](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) tables.

If you want to scan a table for different key values, not just search for exact key values, you should create your keys with `USING BTREE`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b INT, KEY(a), KEY b USING BTREE (b)) ENGINE=memory;
```

In the above table, `a` is a [HASH](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/storage-engine-index-types.md#hash-indexes) key that only supports exact matches (=) while `b` is a [BTREE](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/storage-engine-index-types.md#b-tree-indexes) key that you can use to scan the table in key order, starting from start or from a given key value.

The limitations for `HANDLER READ` with `MEMORY|HEAP` tables are:

## Limitations for HASH keys

* You must use all key parts when searching for a row.
* You can't do a key scan of all values. You can only find all rows with the same key value.
* `READ NEXT` gives an [error 1031](broken-reference) if the tables changed since last read.

## Limitations for BTREE keys

* `READ NEXT` gives an error 1031 if the tables changed since last read. This limitation can be lifted in the future.

## Limitations for table scans

* `READ NEXT` gives an error 1031 if the table was truncated since last `READ` call.
