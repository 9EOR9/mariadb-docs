# Virtual Machine to Test the Cassandra Storage Engine

CassandraSE is no longer actively being developed and has been removed in [MariaDB 10.6](../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-106.md). See [MDEV-23024](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-23024).



Julien Duponchelle has made a virtual machine available for testing the Cassandra storage engine. Find out more at [Cassandra MariaDB VirtualBox](https://julien.duponchelle.info/Cassandra-MariaDB-Virtual-Box.html).


The virtual machine is based on:


* Ubuntu 12.04
* DataStax Cassandra
* [MariaDB 5.5.27](../../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5527-release-notes.md) + Cassandra


[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is used for setup. Full [instructions](https://julien.duponchelle.info/Cassandra-MariaDB-Virtual-Box.html) are at Julien's website.
