# Mroonga Overview

Once Mroonga has been installed (see [About Mroonga](about-mroonga.md)), its basic usage is similar to that of a [regular fulltext index](../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/README.md).

For example:


```
CREATE TABLE ft_mroonga(copy TEXT,FULLTEXT(copy)) ENGINE=Mroonga;

INSERT INTO ft_mroonga(copy) VALUES ('Once upon a time'),
    ('There was a wicked witch'), ('Who ate everybody up');

SELECT * FROM ft_mroonga WHERE MATCH(copy) AGAINST('wicked');
+--------------------------+
| copy                     |
+--------------------------+
| There was a wicked witch |
+--------------------------+
```

## Score


Mroonga can also order by weighting. For example, first add another record:


```
INSERT INTO ft_mroonga(copy) VALUES ('She met a wicked, wicked witch');
```

Records can be returned by weighting, for example, the newly added record has two occurences of the word 'wicked' and a higher weighting:


```
SELECT *, MATCH(copy) AGAINST('wicked') AS score FROM ft_mroonga 
   WHERE MATCH(copy) AGAINST('wicked') ORDER BY score DESC;
+--------------------------------+--------+
| copy                           | score  |
+--------------------------------+--------+
| She met a wicked, wicked witch | 299594 |
| There was a wicked witch       | 149797 |
+--------------------------------+--------+
```

## Parser


Mroonga permits you to set a different parser for searching by specifying the parser in the `CREATE TABLE` statement as a comment or, in older versions, changing the value of the [mroonga_default_parser](mroonga-system-variables.md#mroonga_default_parser) system variable.


For example:


```
CREATE TABLE ft_mroonga(copy TEXT,FULLTEXT(copy) COMMENT 'parser "TokenDelimitNull"') 
  ENGINE=Mroonga;,
```

or


```
SET GLOBAL mroonga_default_parser = 'TokenBigramSplitSymbol';
```

The following parser settings are available:



| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Setting | Description |
| off | No tokenizing is performed. |
| TokenBigram | Default value. Continuous alphabetical characters, numbers or symbols are treated as a token. |
| TokenBigramIgnoreBlank | Same as TokenBigram except that white spaces are ignored. |
| TokenBigramIgnoreBlankSplitSymbol | Same as TokenBigramSplitSymbol. except that white spaces are ignore. |
| TokenBigramIgnoreBlankSplitSymbolAlpha | Same as TokenBigramSplitSymbolAlpha except that white spaces are ignored. |
| TokenBigramIgnoreBlankSplitSymbolAlphaDigit | Same as TokenBigramSplitSymbolAlphaDigit except that white spaces are ignored. |
| TokenBigramSplitSymbol | Same as TokenBigram except that continuous symbols are not treated as a token, but tokenised in bigram. |
| TokenBigramSplitSymbolAlpha | Same as TokenBigram except that continuous alphabetical characters are not treated as a token, but tokenised in bigram. |
| TokenDelimit | Tokenises by splitting on white spaces. |
| TokenDelimitNull | Tokenises by splitting on null characters (\0). |
| TokenMecab | Tokenise using MeCab. Required Groonga to be buillt with MeCab support. |
| TokenTrigram | Tokenises in trigrams but continuous alphabetical characters, numbers or symbols are treated as a token. |
| TokenUnigram | Tokenises in unigrams but continuous alphabetical characters, numbers or symbols are treated as a token. |



### Examples


#### TokenBigram vs TokenBigramSplitSymbol


`TokenBigram` failing to match partial symbols which `TokenBigramSplitSymbol` matches, since `TokenBigramSplitSymbol` does not treat continuous symbols as a token.
