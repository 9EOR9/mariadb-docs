# Differences Between MyRocks Variants

MyRocks is available in


* Facebook's (FB) MySQL branch (originally based on MySQL 5.6)
* MariaDB (from 10.2 and 10.3)
* Percona Server from 5.7


This page lists differences between these variants.


This is a work in progress. The contents are not final



## RocksDB Data Location


FB and Percona store RocksdDB files in $datadir/`.rocksdb`. MariaDB puts them in $datadir/`#rocksdb`. This is more friendly for packaging and OS scripts.


## Compression Algorithms


* FB's branch doesn't provide binaries. One needs to compile it with appropriate compression libraries.


* In MariaDB, available compression algorithms can be seen in the [rocksdb_supported_compression_types](myrocks-system-variables.md#rocksdb_supported_compression_types) variable. From [MariaDB 10.7](../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-107.md), algorithms can be [installed as a plugin](../../../server-usage/replication-cluster-multi-master/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-tuning-compression/compression-plugins.md). In earlier versions, the set of supported compression algorithms depends on the platform. 

  * On Ubuntu 16.04 (current LTS) it is `Snappy,Zlib,LZ4,LZ4HC` .
  * On CentOS 7.4 it is `Snappy,Zlib`.
  * In the bintar tarball it is `Snappy,Zlib`.
* Percona Server supports: `Zlib, ZSTD, LZ4 (the default), LZ4HC`. Unsupported algorithms: `Snappy, BZip2, XPress`.


## RocksDB Version Information


* FB's branch provides the `rocksdb_git_hash` *status* variable.
* MariaDB provides the `@@rocksdb_git_hash` *system* variable.
* Percona Server doesn't provide either.


## RocksDB Version


* Facebook's branch uses RocksDB 5.10.0 (the version number can be found in `include/rocksdb/version.h`)

```

## Binlog Position in information_schema.rocksdb_global_info


* FB branch provides information_schema.rocksdb_global_info type=BINLOG, NAME={FILE, POS, GTID}.
* Percona Server doesn't provide it.
* MariaDB doesn't provide it.


One use of that information is to take the output of `myrocks_hotbackup` and make it a new master.


## Gap Lock Detector


* FB branch has a "Gap Lock Detector" feature. It is at the SQL layer. It can be controlled with `gap_lock_XXX` variables and is disabled by default (gap-lock-raise-error=false, gap-lock-write-lock=false).


* Percona Server has gap lock checking ON but doesn't seem to have any way to control it?
Queries that use Gap Lock on MyRocks fail with an error like this:


```
insert into tbl2 select * from tbl1;
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Using Gap Lock without full unique key in multi-table or multi-statement transactions
is not allowed. You need to either rewrite queries to use all unique key columns in WHERE equal conditions,
or rewrite to single-table, single-statement transaction.  Query: insert into tbl2 select * from tbl1
```

* MariaDB doesn't include the Gap Lock Detector.


## Generated Columns


* Both MariaDB and Percona Server support [generated columns](../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-definition/create/generated-columns.md), but neither one supports them for the MyRocks storage engine (attempts to create a table will produce an error).


* [Invisible columns](../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-definition/create/invisible-columns.md) in [MariaDB 10.3](../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-103.md) are supported (as they are an SQL layer feature).


## rpl_skip_tx_api


Facebook's branch has a performance feature for replication slaves, `rpl_skip_tx_api`. It is not available in MariaDB or in Percona Server.


## Details


The above comparison was made using


* FB/MySQL 5.6.35
* Percona Server 5.7.20-19-log
* [MariaDB 10.2.13](../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-10213-release-notes.md) (MyRocks is beta)
