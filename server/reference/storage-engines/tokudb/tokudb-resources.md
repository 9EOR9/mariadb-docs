# TokuDB Resources

TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream maintainer. It is disabled from [MariaDB 10.5](../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-105.md) and has been been removed in [MariaDB 10.6](../../../../release-notes/mariadb-community-server/what-is-mariadb-106.md) - [MDEV-19780](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19780). We recommend [MyRocks](../myrocks/myrocks-in-mariadb-102-vs-mariadb-103.md) as a long-term migration path.


This page contains links to various online resources for [TokuDB](tokudb-resources.md).
