# Information Schema INNODB\_BUFFER\_POOL\_PAGES\_INDEX Table

The [Information Schema](../../) `INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_PAGES` table is a Percona enhancement, and is only available for XtraDB, not InnoDB (see [XtraDB and InnoDB](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/)). It contains information about [buffer pool](../../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-buffer-pool.md) index pages.

It has the following columns:
