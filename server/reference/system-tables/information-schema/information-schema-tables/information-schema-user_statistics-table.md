# Information Schema USER\_STATISTICS Table

The [Information Schema](../) `USER_STATISTICS` table holds statistics about user activity. This is part of the [User Statistics](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/user-statistics.md) feature, which is not enabled by default.

You can use this table to find out such things as which user is causing the most load and which users are being abusive. You can also use this table to measure how close to capacity the server may be.

It contains the following columns:

| Field                          | Type        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
