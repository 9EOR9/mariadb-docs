# Performance Schema events\_stages\_summary\_by\_thread\_by\_event\_name Table

The table lists stage events, summarized by thread and event name.

It contains the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| THREAD\_ID       | Thread associated with the event. Together with EVENT\_NAME uniquely identifies the row. |
| EVENT\_NAME      | Event name. Used together with THREAD\_ID for grouping events.                           |
| COUNT\_STAR      | Number of summarized events, which includes all timed and untimed events.                |
| SUM\_TIMER\_WAIT | Total wait time of the timed summarized events.                                          |
| MIN\_TIMER\_WAIT | Minimum wait time of the timed summarized events.                                        |
| AVG\_TIMER\_WAIT | Average wait time of the timed summarized events.                                        |
| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT | Maximum wait time of the timed summarized events.                                        |
