# Performance Schema events\_statements\_summary\_by\_account\_by\_event\_name Table

The [Performance Schema](../) events\_statements\_summary\_by\_account\_by\_event\_name table contains statement events summarized by account and event name. It contains the following columns:

| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT                | Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.                             |
| SUM\_LOCK\_TIME                 | Sum of the LOCK\_TIME column in the events\_statements\_current table.                 |
| SUM\_ERRORS                     | Sum of the ERRORS column in the events\_statements\_current table.                     |

| SUM\_ROWS\_EXAMINED             | Sum of the ROWS\_EXAMINED column in the events\_statements\_current table.             |
| SUM\_CREATED\_TMP\_DISK\_TABLES | Sum of the CREATED\_TMP\_DISK\_TABLES column in the events\_statements\_current table. |
| SUM\_CREATED\_TMP\_TABLES       | Sum of the CREATED\_TMP\_TABLES column in the events\_statements\_current table.       |
| SUM\_SELECT\_FULL\_JOIN         | Sum of the SELECT\_FULL\_JOIN column in the events\_statements\_current table.         |
| SUM\_SELECT\_FULL\_RANGE\_JOIN  | Sum of the SELECT\_FULL\_RANGE\_JOIN column in the events\_statements\_current table.  |
| SUM\_SELECT\_RANGE              | Sum of the SELECT\_RANGE column in the events\_statements\_current table.              |
| SUM\_SELECT\_RANGE\_CHECK       | Sum of the SELECT\_RANGE\_CHECK column in the events\_statements\_current table.       |
| SUM\_SELECT\_SCAN               | Sum of the SELECT\_SCAN column in the events\_statements\_current table.               |
| SUM\_SORT\_MERGE\_PASSES        | Sum of the SORT\_MERGE\_PASSES column in the events\_statements\_current table.        |
| SUM\_SORT\_RANGE                | Sum of the SORT\_RANGE column in the events\_statements\_current table.                |
| SUM\_SORT\_ROWS                 | Sum of the SORT\_ROWS column in the events\_statements\_current table.                 |
| SUM\_SORT\_SCAN                 | Sum of the SORT\_SCAN column in the events\_statements\_current table.                 |
| SUM\_NO\_INDEX\_USED            | Sum of the NO\_INDEX\_USED column in the events\_statements\_current table.            |
| SUM\_NO\_GOOD\_INDEX\_USED      | Sum of the NO\_GOOD\_INDEX\_USED column in the events\_statements\_current table.      |

The `*_TIMER_WAIT` columns only calculate results for timed events, as non-timed events have a `NULL` wait time.
