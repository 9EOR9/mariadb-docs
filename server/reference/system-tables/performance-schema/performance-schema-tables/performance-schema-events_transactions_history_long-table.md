# Performance Schema events\_transactions\_history\_long Table

{% hint style="info" %}
The `events_transactions_history_long` table is available from MariaDB 10.5.2.
{% endhint %}

The `events_transactions_history_long` table contains the most recent completed transaction events that have ended globally, across all threads.

The number of records stored in the table is determined by the [performance\_schema\_events\_transactions\_history\_long\_size](../performance-schema-system-variables.md#performance_schema_events_transactions_history_long_size) system variable, which is autosized on startup.

If adding a completed transaction would cause the table to exceed this limit, the oldest row, regardless of thread, is discarded.

The table contains the following columns:

| Column                              | Type                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
