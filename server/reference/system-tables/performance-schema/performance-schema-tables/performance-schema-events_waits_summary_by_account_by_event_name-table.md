# Performance Schema events\_waits\_summary\_by\_account\_by\_event\_name Table

The [Performance Schema](../) `events_waits_summary_by_account_by_event_name` table contains wait events summarized by account and event name. It contains the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| USER             | User. Used together with HOST and EVENT\_NAME for grouping events. |
| HOST             | Host. Used together with USER and EVENT\_NAME for grouping events. |
| EVENT\_NAME      | Event name. Used together with USER and HOST for grouping events.  |
| COUNT\_STAR      | Number of summarized events                                        |
| SUM\_TIMER\_WAIT | Total wait time of the summarized events that are timed.           |
| MIN\_TIMER\_WAIT | Minimum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.         |
| AVG\_TIMER\_WAIT | Average wait time of the summarized events that are timed.         |
| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT | Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.         |

The `*_TIMER_WAIT` columns only calculate results for timed events, as non-timed events have a `NULL` wait time.
