# Performance Schema events\_waits\_summary\_by\_instance Table

The [Performance Schema](../) `events_waits_summary_by_instance` table contains wait events summarized by instance. It contains the following columns:

| Column                  | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVENT\_NAME             | Event name. Used together with OBJECT\_INSTANCE\_BEGIN for grouping events.                                                              |
| OBJECT\_INSTANCE\_BEGIN | If an instrument creates multiple instances, each instance has a unique OBJECT\_INSTANCE\_BEGIN value to allow for grouping by instance. |
| COUNT\_STAR             | Number of summarized events                                                                                                              |
| SUM\_TIMER\_WAIT        | Total wait time of the summarized events that are timed.                                                                                 |
| MIN\_TIMER\_WAIT        | Minimum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.                                                                               |
| AVG\_TIMER\_WAIT        | Average wait time of the summarized events that are timed.                                                                               |
| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT        | Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed.                                                                               |

The `*_TIMER_WAIT` columns only calculate results for timed events, as non-timed events have a `NULL` wait time.
