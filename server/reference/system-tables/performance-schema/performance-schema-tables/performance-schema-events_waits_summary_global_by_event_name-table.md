# Performance Schema events\_waits\_summary\_global\_by\_event\_name Table

The [Performance Schema](../) `events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name` table contains wait events summarized by event name. It contains the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVENT\_NAME      | Event name.                                                |
| COUNT\_STAR      | Number of summarized events                                |
| SUM\_TIMER\_WAIT | Total wait time of the summarized events that are timed.   |
| MIN\_TIMER\_WAIT | Minimum wait time of the summarized events that are timed. |
| AVG\_TIMER\_WAIT | Average wait time of the summarized events that are timed. |
| MAX\_TIMER\_WAIT | Maximum wait time of the summarized events that are timed. |

The `*_TIMER_WAIT` columns only calculate results for timed events, as non-timed events have a `NULL` wait time.
