You can [TRUNCATE](../../../sql-statements/table-statements/truncate-table.md) the table, which will reset all counters to zero. The table is also truncated if the [table\_io\_waits\_summary\_by\_table](performance-schema-table_io_waits_summary_by_table-table.md) table is truncated.

If a table's index structure is changed, index statistics recorded in this table may also be reset.
