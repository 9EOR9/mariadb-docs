# io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_latency and x$io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_latency Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `io_global_by_file_by_latency` and `x$io_global_by_file_by_latency` views summarize global I/O consumers to display time waiting for I/O, grouped by file. Rows are sorted by descending total latency by default.

The `io_global_by_file_by_latency` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$io_global_by_file_by_latency` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| file           | File path name.                                         |
| total          | Total number of I/O events for the file.                |
| total\_latency | Total wait time of timed I/O events for the file.       |
| count\_read    | Total number of read I/O events for the file.           |
| read\_latency  | Total wait time of timed read I/O events for the file.  |
| count\_write   | Total number of write I/O events for the file.          |
| write\_latency | Total wait time of timed write I/O events for the file. |
| count\_misc    | Total number of other I/O events for the file.          |
| misc\_latency  | Total wait time of timed other I/O events for the file. |
