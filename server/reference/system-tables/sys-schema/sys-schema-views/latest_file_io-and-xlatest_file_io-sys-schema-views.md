# latest\_file\_io and x$latest\_file\_io Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `latest_file_io` and `x$latest_file_io` views summarize file I/O activity, grouped by file and thread. Rows are sorted by most recent I/O by default.

The `latest_file_io` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$latest_file_io` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:
