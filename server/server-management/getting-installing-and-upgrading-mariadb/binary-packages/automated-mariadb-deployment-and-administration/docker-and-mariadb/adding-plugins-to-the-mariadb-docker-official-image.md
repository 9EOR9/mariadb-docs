# Adding Plugins to the MariaDB Docker Official Image

MariaDB has many plugins. Most are not enabled by default, some are in the `mariadb` container, while others need to be installed from additional packages.


The following methods summarize [Installing plugins in the MariaDB Docker Library Container](https://mariadb.org/installing-plugins-in-the-mariadb-docker-library-container/) (mariadb.org blog post) on this topic.


### Which Plugins Does the Container Contain?


To see which plugins are available in the mariadb:


```
$ docker run --rm mariadb:latest ls -C /usr/lib/mysql/plugin
```

### Enabling a Plugin Using Flags


Using the `--plugin-load-add` flag with the plugin name (can be repeated), the plugins will be loaded and ready when the container is started:


For example, to enable the `simple\_password\_check` plugin:


```
$ docker run --name some-%%REPO%% -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --network=host -d mariadb:latest --plugin-load-add=simple_password_check
```

### Enabling a Plugin in the Configuration Files


plugin-load-add` can be used as a configuration option to load plugins. The example below loads the [FederatedX Storage Engine](../../../../../reference/storage-engines/federatedx-storage-engine/README.md).


```
$ printf "[mariadb]\nplugin-load-add=ha_federatedx\n" > /my/custom/federatedx.conf
$ docker run --name some-mariadb -v /my/custom:/etc/mysql/conf.d -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb:latest
```

### Install a Plugin Using SQL in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d


[INSTALL SONAME](../../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/install-soname.md) can be used to install a plugin as part of the database initialization.


Create the SQL file used in initialization:


```
$ echo 'INSTALL SONAME "disks";' > my_initdb/disks.sql
```

In this case, the `my\_initdb` is a `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory per "Initializing a fresh instance" section above.


### Identifying Additional Plugins in Additional Packages


A number of plugins are in separate packages to reduce their installation size. The package names of MariaDB-created plugins can be determined using the following command:


```
$ docker run --rm mariadb:latest sh -c 'apt-get update -qq && apt-cache search mariadb-plugin'
```

### Creating an Image With Plugins From Additional Packages


A new image needs to be created when using additional packages. The `mariadb` image can however be used as a base:


In the following, the [CONNECT Storage Engine](../../../../../reference/storage-engines/connect/README.md) is installed:


```
FROM mariadb:latest
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install mariadb-plugin-connect -y && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Installing plugins from packages creates a configuration file in the directory `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/` that loads the plugin on startup.
