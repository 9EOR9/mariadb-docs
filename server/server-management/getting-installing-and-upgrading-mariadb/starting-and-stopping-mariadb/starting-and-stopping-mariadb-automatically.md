# Starting and Stopping MariaDB Server


There are several different methods to start or stop the MariaDB Server process. There are two primary categories that most of these methods fall into: starting the process with the help of a service manager, and starting the process manually.


## Service Managers


[sysVinit](sysvinit.md) and [systemd](systemd.md) are the most common Linux service managers. [launchd](launchd.md) is used in MacOS X. [Upstart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart_(software)) is a less common service manager.


### Systemd


RHEL/CentOS 7 and above, Debian 8 Jessie and above, and Ubuntu 15.04 and above use [systemd](systemd.md) by default.


For information on how to start and stop MariaDB with this service manager, see [systemd: Interacting with the MariaDB Server Process](systemd.md#interacting-with-the-mariadb-server-process).


### SysVinit


RHEL/CentOS 6 and below, and Debian 7 Wheezy and below use [sysVinit](sysvinit.md) by default.


For information on how to start and stop MariaDB with this service manager, see [sysVinit: Interacting with the MariaDB Server Process](sysvinit.md#interacting-with-the-mariadb-server-process).


### launchd


[launchd](launchd.md) is used in MacOS X.


### Upstart


Ubuntu 14.10 and below use Upstart by default.


## Starting the Server Process Manually


### mariadbd


[mariadbd](mariadbd-options.md) is the actual MariaDB Server binary. It can be started manually on its own.


### mariadbd-safe


[mariadbd-safe](mariadbd-safe.md) is a wrapper that can be used to start the [mariadbd](mariadbd-options.md) server process. The script has some built-in safeguards, such as automatically restarting the server process if it dies. See [mariadbd-safe](mariadbd-safe.md) for more information.


### mariadbd-multi


[mariadbd-multi](mariadbd-multi.md) is a wrapper that can be used to start the [mariadbd](mariadbd-options.md) server process if you plan to run multiple server processes on the same host. See [mariadbd-multi](mariadbd-multi.md) for more information.


### mysql.server


[mysql.server](../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-servers-table.md) is a wrapper that works as a standard [sysVinit](sysvinit.md) script. However, it can be used independently of [sysVinit](sysvinit.md) as a regular `<code>sh</code>` script. The script starts the [mariadbd](mariadbd-options.md) server process by first changing its current working directory to the MariaDB install directory and then starting [mariadbd-safe](mariadbd-safe.md). The script requires the standard [sysVinit](sysvinit.md) arguments, such as `<code>start</code>`, `<code>stop</code>`, and `<code>status</code>`. See [mysql.server](../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-servers-table.md) for more information.
