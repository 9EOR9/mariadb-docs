# Checking MariaDB RPM Package Signatures

MariaDB RPM packages since [MariaDB 5.1.55](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-1-series/mariadb-5155-release-notes) are signed.

The key we use has an id of `1BB943DB` and the key fingerprint is:

```
1993 69E5 404B D5FC 7D2F E43B CBCB 082A 1BB9 43DB
```

To check the signature you first need to import the public part of the key like so:

```
gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 1BB943DB
```

Next you need to let pgp know about the key like so:

```
gpg --export --armour 1BB943DB > mariadb-signing-key.asc
sudo rpm --import mariadb-signing-key.asc
```

You can check to see if the key was imported with:

```
rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*
```

Once the key is imported, you can check the signature of the MariaDB RPM files by running the something like the following in your download directory:

```
rpm --checksig $(find . -name '*.rpm')
```

The output of the above will look something like this (make sure gpg shows up on each OK line):

```
me@desktop:~$ rpm --checksig $(find . -name '*.rpm')
./kvm-rpm-centos5-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-test-5.1.55-98.el5.x86_64.rpm: (sha1) dsa sha1 md5 gpg OK

./kvm-rpm-centos5-amd64/srpms/MariaDB-5.1.55-98.el5.src.rpm: (sha1) dsa sha1 md5 gpg OK
```
