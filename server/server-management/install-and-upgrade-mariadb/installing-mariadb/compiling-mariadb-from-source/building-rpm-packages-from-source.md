# Building RPM Packages From Source

To generate RPM packages from the build, supply the `-DRPM=xxx` flag to CMake, where the value `xxx` is the name of the distribution you're building for. For example, centos7 or rocky8 or fedora39 or sles15.

What these do are controlled in the following CMake files:

* `cmake/cpack_rpm.cmake`
* `cmake/build_configurations/mysql_release.cmake`
* `cmake/mariadb_connector_c.cmake`

To build the packages you should execute:

```
$ umask 0022
$ cmake --build . --target package
```
