# Upgrading Between Minor Versions on Linux

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md) instead.

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [mariadb-backup](../../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup/).

To upgrade between minor versions of MariaDB on Linux/Unix (for example from [MariaDB 10.11.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-4-release-notes) to [MariaDB 10.11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-5-release-notes)), the following procedure is suggested:

1. Stop MariaDB.
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.
3. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

4. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`.
5. Start MariaDB.
