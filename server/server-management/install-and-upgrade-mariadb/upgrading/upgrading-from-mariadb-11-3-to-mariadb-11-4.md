### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md).

For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see [Upgrading from MariaDB 10.6 to MariaDB 10.7 with Galera Cluster](../../getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/upgrading/upgrading-from-mariadb-106-to-mariadb-107-with-galera-cluster/) instead.

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [Mariabackup](../../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariabackup/).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 11.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-11-4-series/what-is-mariadb-114). For example,

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.

1. [Stop MariaDB](../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`

1. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

1. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
2. [Start MariaDB](../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Run [mariadb-upgrade](../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-upgrade.md).

* `mariadb-upgrade` does two things:
  1. Ensures that the system tables in the [mysql](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) database are fully compatible with the new version.
  2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB .

### Incompatible Changes Between 11.3 and 11.4

#### Options That Have Been Removed

The following options should be removed if you use them in your [option files](../configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Option                                                                                                                                            | Reason       |
| [debug\_no\_thread\_alarm](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#debug_no_thread_alarm) | Unused code. |
