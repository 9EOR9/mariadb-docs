# Upgrading from MariaDB 10.6 to MariaDB 10.11

### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](../upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md).

For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see [Upgrading from MariaDB 10.6 to MariaDB 10.11 with Galera Cluster](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/galera-management/upgrading-galera-cluster/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11-with-galeracluster).

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [mariadb-backup](../../../../server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/mariadb-backup-overview.md).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 10.11](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-11-series/what-is-mariadb-1011). For example,

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.

1. [Stop MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`

1. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

1. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
2. [Start MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Run [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md).

* `mariadb-upgrade` does two things:
  1. Ensures that the system tables in the [mysql](../../../../reference/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) database are fully compatible with the new version.
  2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB .

### Incompatible Changes Between 10.6 and 10.11

On most servers upgrading from 10.6 should be painless. However, there are some things that have changed which could affect an upgrade:

#### Compression

If a non-zlib compression algorithm was used in [InnoDB](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) or [Mroonga](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/mroonga/) before upgrading to 10.11, those tables will be unreadable until the appropriate compression library is installed. See [Compression Plugins#Upgrading](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-tuning-compression/compression-plugins.md#upgrading).

#### Deprecated Options

The following options have been deprecated. They have not yet been removed, but will be in a future version, and should ideally no longer be used.

| Option                                                                                                                                             | Reason                                                                       |

| [keep\_files\_on\_create](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#keep_files_on_create) | MariaDB now deletes orphan files, so this setting should never be necessary. |
