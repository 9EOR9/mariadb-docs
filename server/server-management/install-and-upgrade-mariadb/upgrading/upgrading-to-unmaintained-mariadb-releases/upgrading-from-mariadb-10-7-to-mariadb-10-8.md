# Upgrading from MariaDB 10.7 to MariaDB 10.8

### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](../upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md).

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [Mariabackup](../../../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariabackup/).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 10.8](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-8-series/what-is-mariadb-108). For example,

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.

1. [Stop MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`

1. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

1. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
2. [Start MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Run [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md).

* `mariadb-upgrade` does two things:
  1. Ensures that the system tables in the [mysql](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) database are fully compatible with the new version.
  2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB .

### Incompatible Changes Between 10.7 and 10.8

On most servers upgrading from 10.7 should be painless. However, there are some things that have changed which could affect an upgrade:

#### Options That Have Changed Default Values

| Option                                                                                                                                        | Old default value | New default value |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Option                                                                                                                                        | Old default value | New default value |
| [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_chunk\_size](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size) | 134217728         | Autosized         |
| [spider\_semi\_table\_lock](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/spider/spider-system-variables.md)                                       | 1                 | 0                 |

#### Options That Have Been Removed or Renamed

The following options should be removed or renamed if you use them in your [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Option                                                                                                                                    | Reason                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Option                                                                                                                                    | Reason                                                                                                |
| [innodb\_log\_write\_ahead\_size](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_log_write_ahead_size) | On Linux and Windows, the physical block size of the underlying storage is instead detected and used. |

#### Deprecated Options

The following options have been deprecated. They have not yet been removed, but will be in a future version, and should ideally no longer be used.

| Option                                                                                                                                             | Reason                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Option                                                                                                                                             | Reason                                                                       |
| [keep\_files\_on\_create](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#keep_files_on_create) | MariaDB now deletes orphan files, so this setting should never be necessary. |

### Major New Features To Consider

You might consider using the following major new features in [MariaDB 10.8](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-8-series/what-is-mariadb-108):

* Stored procedures already have support for the [IN, OUT and INOUT](../../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/create-procedure.md#inoutinout) parameter qualifiers. Added as well for [stored functions](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-function.md#in-out-inout-in-out) and (IN only) [cursors](../../../../server-usage/programmatic-compound-statements/programmatic-compound-statements-cursors/declare-cursor.md#in) ([MDEV-10654](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10654)).
* Individual columns in the [index](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/) can now be explicitly sorted in the ascending or descending order. This can be useful for optimizing certain [ORDER BY](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/order-by.md) cases ([MDEV-13756](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13756), [MDEV-26938](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26938), [MDEV-26939](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26939), [MDEV-26996](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26996)).
* See also [System Variables Added in MariaDB 10.8](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/system-and-status-variables-added-by-major-release/system-and-status-variables-added-by-major-unmaintained-release/system-variables-added-in-mariadb-10-8.md).
