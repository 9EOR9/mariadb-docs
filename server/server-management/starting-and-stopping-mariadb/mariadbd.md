Prior to [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), the client was called `mysqld`. It can still be accessed under this name, via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadbd-options](mariadbd-options.md) for details.
