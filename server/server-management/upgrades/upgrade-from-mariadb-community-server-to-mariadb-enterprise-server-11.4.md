# Upgrade from MariaDB Community Server to MariaDB Enterprise Server 11.4

These instructions detail the **upgrade** from **MariaDB Community Server** to **MariaDB Enterprise Server 11.4** on a range of [supported Operating Systems](https://mariadb.com/engineering-policies/).

When [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/) is upgraded, the old version needs to be uninstalled, and the new version needs to be installed.

### Data Backup

Occasionally, issues can be encountered during upgrades. These issues can even potentially corrupt the database's data files, preventing you from easily reverting to the old installation. Therefore, it is generally best to perform a backup prior to upgrading. If an issue is encountered during the upgrade, you can use the backup to restore your MariaDB Server database to the old version. If the upgrade finishes without issue, then the backup can be deleted.

The instructions below show how to perform a backup using [MariaDB Backup](../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariabackup/). For more information about backing up and restoring the database, please see the [Recovery Guide](../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/backup-and-restore-with-mariadb-enterprise-server/).

1.  Take a full backup.

    On MariaDB Community Server 10.4 and later:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mariadb-backup --backup \
          --user=mariabackup_user \
          --password=mariabackup_passwd \
          --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
    ```

    On MariaDB Community Server 10.3 and earlier:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mariabackup --backup \
          --user=mariabackup_user \
          --password=mariabackup_passwd \
          --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
    ```

    Confirm successful completion of the backup operation.
2.  The backup must be prepared.

    On MariaDB Community Server 10.4 and later:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mariadb-backup --prepare \
          --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
    ```

    On MariaDB Community Server 10.3 and earlier:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mariabackup --prepare \
          --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
    ```

    Confirm successful completion of the prepare operation.
3. Backups should be tested before they are trusted.

### Audit Plugin Considerations

If you have the [MariaDB Audit Plugin](../../reference/plugins/mariadb-audit-plugin/) installed and if you are upgrading to MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later, then the audit plugin should be removed prior to the upgrade to prevent conflict with the MariaDB Enterprise Audit Plugin that is present in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later.

It can be removed by using the [UNINSTALL SONAME](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/plugin-sql-statements/uninstall-soname.md) statement:

```sql
UNINSTALL SONAME 'server_audit';
```

And if you load the plugin in a configuration file using the `plugin_load_add` option, then the option should also be removed.

The MariaDB Enterprise Audit Plugin will automatically be installed after installing MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later.

### Convert InnoDB Row Format

MariaDB Enterprise Server 11.4 changes the `COMPRESSED` row format to read-only. Before upgrading, modify any compressed InnoDB tables to use the `DYNAMIC` row format.

1.  Use the `information\_schema.INNODB\_SYS\_TABLES` to identify any InnoDB tables that use the `COMPRESSED` row format:

    ```sql
    SELECT NAME, ROW_FORMAT
    FROM information_schema.INNODB_SYS_TABLES
    WHERE NAME NOT LIKE 'SYS_%'
       AND ROW_FORMAT = 'COMPRESSED';
    ```
2.  Execute an [ALTER TABLE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) statement for each table, changing its row format from `COMPRESSED` to `DYNAMIC`:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE accounts.hq_sales
    ROW_FORMAT = DYNAMIC
    PAGE_COMPRESSED = 1;
    ```

### Uninstall the Old Version

When upgrading to MariaDB Enterprise Server, it is necessary to remove the existing installation of MariaDB Community Server, before installing MariaDB Enterprise Server. Otherwise, the package manager will refuse to install MariaDB Enterprise Server.

#### Stop the MariaDB Server Process

Before the old version can be uninstalled, we first need to stop the current MariaDB Server process.

1.  Set the [innodb\_fast\_shutdown](../../reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_fast_shutdown) system variable to `1`:

    ```sql
    SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 1;
    ```
2.  Use [XA RECOVER](../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/xa-transactions.md#xa-recover) to confirm that there are no external XA transactions in a prepared state:

    ```sql
    XA RECOVER;
    ```

    Commit or rollback any open XA transactions before stopping the node for upgrade.
3.  Stop the server process:

    For distributions that use systemd (most supported OSes), you can manage the Server process using the `systemctl` command:

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl stop mariadb
    ```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Configuration

For platforms that use YUM or ZYpp as a package manager:

MariaDB Community Server's packages bundle several configuration files:

* `/etc/my.cnf`
* `/etc/my.cnf.d/client.cnf`
* `/etc/my.cnf.d/mysql-clients.cnf`
* `/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf`

If your version of any of these configuration files contained any custom edits, then the package manager may save your edited version with the `.rpmsave` extension during the upgrade process. If you want to continue using your version with the custom edits, then you may need to move it back. For example, to move `server.cnf` back in place:

```
$ sudo mv /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf.original
```

```
$ sudo mv /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf.rpmsave /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf
```

### Starting the Server

MariaDB Enterprise Server includes configuration to start, stop, restart, enable/disable on boot, and check the status of the Server using the operating system default process management system.

For distributions that use systemd, you can manage the Server process using the `systemctl` command:

| **Operation**          | **Command**                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Start                  | `sudo systemctl start mariadb`   |
| Stop                   | `sudo systemctl stop mariadb`    |
| Restart                | `sudo systemctl restart mariadb` |
| Enable during startup  | `sudo systemctl enable mariadb`  |
| Disable during startup | `sudo systemctl disable mariadb` |
| Status                 | `sudo systemctl status mariadb`  |

### Upgrading the Data Directory

MariaDB Enterprise Server ships with a utility that can be used to identify and correct compatibility issues in the new version. After you upgrade your Server and start the server process, run this utility to upgrade the data directory.

The utility is called [mariadb-upgrade](../../clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md) in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 and later:

```bash
$ sudo mariadb-upgrade
```

And the utility is called `mysql\_upgrade` in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3 and 10.2:

```bash
$ sudo mysql_upgrade
```

### Testing

When MariaDB Enterprise Server is up and running on your system, you should test that it is working and there weren't any issues during startup.

1.  Connect to the server using MariaDB Client using the `root@localhost` user account.

    MariaDB Client is called [mariadb](../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/) (ES10.4 and later) or `mysql` (ES10.3 and earlier):

    ```bash
    $ sudo mariadb
    ```

    ```
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 9
    Server version: 11.4.5-3-MariaDB MariaDB Server

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    MariaDB [(none)]>
    ```
2.  You can also verify the server version by checking the value of the [version](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#list-of-server-system-variables) system variable with the [SHOW GLOBAL STATUS](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status.md) statement:

    ```sql
    SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'version';
    ```

    ```
    +---------------+------------------+
    | Variable_name | Value            |
    +---------------+------------------+
    | version       | 11.4.5-3-MariaDB |
    +---------------+------------------+
    ```
3.  You can also verify the server version by calling the [VERSION()](../../reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/version.md) function:

    ```sql
    SELECT VERSION();
    ```

    ```
    +------------------+
    | VERSION()        |
    +------------------+
    | 11.4.5-3-MariaDB |
    +------------------+
    ```
