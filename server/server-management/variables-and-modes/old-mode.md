# OLD\_MODE

The [old\_mode](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable was introduced in [MariaDB 5.5.35](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5535-release-notes) to replace the [old](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#old) variable with a new one with better granularity.

MariaDB supports several different modes which allow you to tune it to suit your needs.

The most important ways for doing this are with [SQL\_MODE](sql-mode.md) and `OLD_MODE`.

[SQL\_MODE](sql-mode.md) is used for getting MariaDB to emulate behavior from other SQL servers, while `OLD_MODE` is used for emulating behavior from older MariaDB or MySQL versions.

`OLD_MODE` is a string with different options separated by commas ('`,`') without spaces. The options are case insensitive.

Normally `OLD_MODE` should be empty. It's mainly used to get old behavior when switching to MariaDB or to a new major version of MariaDB, until you have time to fix your application.

Between major versions of MariaDB various options supported by `OLD_MODE` may be removed. This is intentional as we assume that the application will be fixed to conform with the new MariaDB behavior between releases.

In other words, `OLD_MODE` options are by design deprecated from the day they were added and will eventually be removed [as any other deprecated feature](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/about/feature-deprecation-policy).

You can check the variable's local and global value with:

```sql
SELECT @@OLD_MODE, @@GLOBAL.OLD_MODE;
```

You can set the `OLD_MODE` either from the [command line](../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md) (option `--old-mode`) or by setting the [old\_mode](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable.

Non-default old mode features are deprecated by design, and from [MariaDB 11.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-3-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-113), a warning will be issued when set.

## Modes

The different values of `OLD_MODE` are:

### COMPAT\_5\_1\_CHECKSUM

From [MariaDB 10.9](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/what-is-mariadb-109), the [--old option](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#old) is deprecated. This option allows behaviour of the --old option for enabling the old-style checksum for `CHECKSUM TABLE` that MySQL 5.1 supports

### IGNORE\_INDEX\_ONLY\_FOR\_JOIN

From [MariaDB 10.9](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/what-is-mariadb-109), the [--old option](../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#old) is deprecated. This option allows behaviour of the --old option for disabling the index only for joins, but allow it for ORDER BY.

### LOCK\_ALTER\_TABLE\_COPY

From [MariaDB 11.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/what-is-mariadb-112). The non-locking copy ALTER introduced in [MDEV-16329](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16329) should be beneficial in the vast majority of cases, but scenarios can exist which significantly impact performance. For example, RBR on tables without a primary key. When non-locking ALTER is performed on such a table, and DML affecting a large number of records is run in parallel, the ALTER can become extremely slow, and further DML can also be affected. If there is a chance of such scenarios (and no possibility of improving the schema by immediately adding primary keys), ALTER should be performed with the explicit LOCK=SHARED clause. If this is also impossible, then LOCK\_ALTER\_TABLE\_COPY flag should be added to the old\_mode variable until the schema can be improved.

### NO\_DUP\_KEY\_WARNINGS\_WITH\_IGNORE

Don't print duplicate key warnings when using INSERT [IGNORE](../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/ignore.md).

### NO\_NULL\_COLLATION\_IDS

A compatibility setting to support connectors (in particular MySQL Connector/NET) that give an exception when collation ids returned by [SHOW COLLATION](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-collation.md) are NULL. It is automatically set when a MySQL Connector/NET connection is determined. From [MariaDB 10.11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-7-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.0.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-0-series/mariadb-11-0-5-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.1.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-1-series/mariadb-11-1-4-release-notes), [MariaDB 11.2.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/mariadb-11-2-3-release-notes).

### NO\_PROGRESS\_INFO

Don't show progress information in [SHOW PROCESSLIST](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-processlist.md).

### OLD\_FLUSH\_STATUS

From [MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115), restores the pre-[MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115) behavior of [FLUSH STATUS](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md#flush-status).

### SESSION\_USER\_IS\_USER

From [MariaDB 11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117), restores the pre-[MariaDB 11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117) behavior of [SESSION\_USER](../../reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/session_user.md).

### UTF8\_IS\_UTF8MB3

From [MariaDB 10.6.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-1061-release-notes), the main name of the previous 3 byte `utf` [character set](../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) has been changed to `utf8mb3`. If set, the default, `utf8` is an alias for `utf8mb3`. If not set, `utf8` would be an alias for `utf8mb4`.

### ZERO\_DATE\_TIME\_CAST

When a [TIME](../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/time.md) value is cast to a [DATETIME](../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime.md), the date part will be `0000-00-00`, not [CURRENT\_DATE](../../reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/curdate.md) (as dictated by the SQL standard).

## OLD\_MODE and Stored Programs

In contrast to [SQL\_MODE](sql-mode.md), [stored programs](../../server-usage/stored-routines/) use the current user's `OLD_MODE`value.

Changes to `OLD_MODE` are not sent to replicas.

## Examples

This example shows how to get a readable list of enabled OLD\_MODE flags:

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(@@OLD_MODE, ',', '\n');
+---------------------------------------------------+
| REPLACE(@@OLD_MODE, ',', '\n')                    |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| NO_DUP_KEY_WARNINGS_WITH_IGNORE                   |
| NO_PROGRESS_INFO                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

Adding a new flag:

```sql
SET @@OLD_MODE = CONCAT(@@OLD_MODE, ',NO_PROGRESS_INFO');
```

If the specified flag is already ON, the above example has no effect but does not produce an error.

How to unset a flag:

```sql
SET @@OLD_MODE = REPLACE(@@OLD_MODE, 'NO_PROGRESS_INFO', '');
```

How to check if a flag is set:

```sql
SELECT @@OLD_MODE LIKE '%NO_PROGRESS_INFO';
+------------------------------------+
| @@OLD_MODE LIKE '%NO_PROGESS_INFO' |
+------------------------------------+
|                                  1 |
+------------------------------------+
```
