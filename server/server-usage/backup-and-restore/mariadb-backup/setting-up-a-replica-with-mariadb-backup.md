# Setting up a Replica with mariadb-backup

{% hint style="info" %}
The terms _master_ and _slave_ have historically been used in replication, and MariaDB has begun the process of adding _primary_ and _replica_ synonyms. The old terms will continue to be used to maintain backward compatibility - see [MDEV-18777](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18777) to follow progress on this effort.
{% endhint %}

mariadb-backup makes it very easy to set up a replica using a full backup. This page documents how to set up a replica from a backup.

If you are using MariaDB Galera Cluster, then you may want to try one of the following pages instead:

* [Configuring MariaDB Replication between MariaDB Galera Cluster and MariaDB Server](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/using-mariadb-replication-with-mariadb-galera-cluster-configuring-mariadb-r/)
* [Configuring MariaDB Replication between Two MariaDB Galera Clusters](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/high-availability/using-mariadb-replication-with-mariadb-galera-cluster/configuring-mariadb-replication-between-two-mariadb-galera-clusters)

### Backup the Database and Prepare It

The first step is to simply take and prepare a fresh full backup of a database server in the replication topology. If the source database server is the desired replication primary, then we do not need to add any additional options when taking the full backup. For example:

```bash
$ mariadb-backup --backup \
   --target-dir=/var/mariadb/backup/ \
   --user=mariadb-backup --password=mypassword
```

If the source database server is a replica of the desired primary, then we should add the --slave-info option, and possibly the --safe-slave-backup option. For example:

```bash
$ mariadb-backup --backup \
   --slave-info --safe-slave-backup \
   --target-dir=/var/mariadb/backup/ \
   --user=mariadb-backup --password=mypassword
```

And then we would prepare the backup as you normally would. For example:

```bash
$ mariadb-backup --prepare \
   --target-dir=/var/mariadb/backup/
```

### Copy the Backup to the New Replica

Once the backup is done and prepared, we can copy it to the new replica. For example:

```bash
$ rsync -avP /var/mariadb/backup dbserver2:/var/mariadb/backup
```

### Restore the Backup on the New Replica

At this point, we can restore the backup to the datadir, as you normally would. For example:

```bash
$ mariadb-backup --copy-back \
   --target-dir=/var/mariadb/backup/
```

And adjusting file permissions, if necessary:

```bash
$ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql/
```

### Create a Replication User on the Primary

Before the new replica can begin replicating from the primary, we need to create a user account on the primary that the replica can use to connect, and we need to grant the user account the REPLICATION SLAVE privilege. For example:

```sql
CREATE USER 'repl'@'dbserver2' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.*  TO 'repl'@'dbserver2';
```

### Configure the New Replica

Before we start the server on the new replica, we need to configure it. At the very least, we need to ensure that it has a unique server\_id value. We also need to make sure other replication settings are what we want them to be, such as the various GTID system variables, if those apply in the specific environment.

Once configuration is done, we can [start the MariaDB Server process](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/) on the new replica.

### Start Replication on the New Replica

At this point, we need to get the replication coordinates of the primary from the original backup directory.

If we took the backup on the primary, then the coordinates will be in the xtrabackup\_binlog\_info file. If we took the backup on another replica and if we provided the --slave-info option, then the coordinates will be in the file xtrabackup\_slave\_info file.

mariadb-backup dumps replication coordinates in two forms: GTID coordinates and binary log file and position coordinates, like the ones you would normally see from SHOW MASTER STATUS output. We can choose which set of coordinates we would like to use to set up replication.

For example:

```bash
mariadb-bin.000096 568 0-1-2
```

Regardless of the coordinates we use, we will have to set up the primary connection using CHANGE MASTER TO and then start the replication threads with START SLAVE.

#### GTIDs

If we want to use GTIDs, then we will have to first set gtid\_slave\_pos to the GTID coordinates that we pulled from either the xtrabackup\_binlog\_info file or the xtrabackup\_slave\_info file in the backup directory. For example:

```bash
$ cat xtrabackup_binlog_info
mariadb-bin.000096 568 0-1-2
```

And then we would set `MASTER_USE_GTID=slave_pos` in the CHANGE MASTER TO command. For example:

```sql
SET GLOBAL gtid_slave_pos = "0-1-2";
CHANGE MASTER TO 
   MASTER_HOST="dbserver1", 
   MASTER_PORT=3306, 
   MASTER_USER="repl",  
   MASTER_PASSWORD="password", 
   MASTER_USE_GTID=slave_pos;
START SLAVE;
```

#### File and Position

If we want to use the binary log file and position coordinates, then we would set `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and `MASTER_LOG_POS` in the CHANGE MASTER TO command to the file and position coordinates that we pulled; either the xtrabackup\_binlog\_info file or the xtrabackup\_slave\_info file in the backup directory, depending on whether the backup was taken from the primary or from a replica of the primary. For example:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO 
   MASTER_HOST="dbserver1", 
   MASTER_PORT=3306, 
   MASTER_USER="repl",  
   MASTER_PASSWORD="password", 
   MASTER_LOG_FILE='mariadb-bin.000096',
   MASTER_LOG_POS=568;
START SLAVE;
```

### Check the Status of the New Replica

We should be done setting up the replica now, so we should check its status with SHOW SLAVE STATUS. For example:

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```
