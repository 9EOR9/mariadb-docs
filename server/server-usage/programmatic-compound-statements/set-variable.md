# SET Variable

## Syntax

```
SET var_name = expr [, var_name = expr] ...
```

## Description

The `SET` statement in [stored programs](../stored-routines/) is an extended version of the general `[SET](../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md)` statement. Referenced variables may be ones declared inside a stored program, global system variables, or user-defined variables.

The `SET` statement in stored programs is implemented as part of the\
pre-existing [SET](../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md) syntax. This allows an extended syntax of `SET a=x, b=y, ...` where different variable types (locally declared variables,\
global and session server variables, user-defined variables) can be\
mixed. This also allows combinations of local variables and some\
options that make sense only for system variables; in that case, the\
options are recognized but ignored.

`SET` can be used with both [local variables](declare-variable.md) and [user-defined variables](../../reference/sql-structure/sql-language-structure/user-defined-variables.md).

When setting several variables using the columns returned by a query, `[SELECT INTO](selectinto.md)` should be preferred.

To set many variables to the same value, the `[LAST_VALUE( )](../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_value.md)` function can be used.

Below is an example of how a user-defined variable may be set:

```
SET @x = 1;
```
