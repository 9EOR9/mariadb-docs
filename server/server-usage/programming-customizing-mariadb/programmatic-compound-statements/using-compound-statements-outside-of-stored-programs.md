# Using Compound Statements Outside of Stored Programs

Compound statements can also be used outside of [stored programs](../stored-routines/README.md).

IF @have_innodb THEN
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS innodb_index_stats (
    database_name    VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    table_name       VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    index_name       VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    last_update      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    stat_name        VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,

    sample_size      BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    stat_description VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL,

Note, that using compound statements this way is subject to following limitations:


* Only [BEGIN](begin-end.md), [IF](../../../ref/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/ifnull.md), [CASE](case-statement.md), [LOOP](loop.md), [WHILE](while.md), [REPEAT](repeat-loop.md) statements may start a compound statement outside of stored programs.
* [BEGIN](begin-end.md) must use the `BEGIN NOT ATOMIC` syntax (otherwise it'll be confused with [BEGIN](../../../ref/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/transactions/start-transaction.md) that starts a transaction).
* A compound statement might not start with a label.
* A compound statement is parsed completely—note "2 warnings" in the above example, even if the condition was false (InnoDB was, indeed, disabled), and the [CREATE TABLE](../../../ref/sql-statements-and-structure/vectors/create-table-with-vectors.md) statement was not executed, it was still parsed and the parser produced "Unknown storage engine" warning.


Inside a compound block first three limitations do not apply, one can use anything that can be used inside a stored program — including labels, condition handlers, variables, and so on:


```
BEGIN NOT ATOMIC
    DECLARE foo CONDITION FOR 1146;
    DECLARE x INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SET x=1;
    INSERT INTO test.t1 VALUES ("hndlr1", val, 2);
    END|
```

Example how to use `IF`:


```
IF (1>0) THEN BEGIN NOT ATOMIC SELECT 1; END ; END IF;;
```

Example of how to use `WHILE` loop:


```
DELIMITER |
BEGIN NOT ATOMIC
    DECLARE x INT DEFAULT 0;
    WHILE x <= 10 DO
        SET x = x + 1;
        SELECT x;
    END WHILE;
END|
DELIMITER ;
```
