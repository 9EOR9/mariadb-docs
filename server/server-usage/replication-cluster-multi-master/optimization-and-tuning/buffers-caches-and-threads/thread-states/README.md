# Thread States

Thread states can be viewed with the `STATE` values listed by the [SHOW PROCESSLIST](../../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-processlist.md) statement or in the [Information Schema PROCESSLIST Table](../../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-processlist-table.md) as well as the `PROCESSLIST_STATE` value listed in the [Performance Schema threads Table](../../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-threads-table.md). `Slave_IO_State` shown by [SHOW SLAVE STATUS](/en/show-slave-status/) also shows slave-related thread states.
