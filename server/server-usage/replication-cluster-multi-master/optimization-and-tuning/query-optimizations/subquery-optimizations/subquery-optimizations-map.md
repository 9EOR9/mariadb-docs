# Subquery Optimizations Map

Below is a map showing all types of subqueries allowed in the SQL language, and
the optimizer strategies available to handle them.


* Uncolored areas represent different kinds of subqueries, for example:

  * Subqueries that have form `x IN (SELECT ...)`
  * Subqueries that are in the `FROM` clause
  * .. and so forth
* The size of each uncolored area roughly corresponds to how important (i.e.
 frequently used) that kind of subquery is. For
 example, `x IN (SELECT ...)` queries are the most important,
 and `EXISTS (SELECT ...)` are relatively unimportant.
* Colored areas represent optimizations/execution strategies that are applied
 to handle various kinds of subqueries.
* The color of optimization indicates which version of MySQL/MariaDB it was
 available in (see legend below)

Some things are not on the map:


* MariaDB doesn't evaluate expensive subqueries when doing optimization 
 (this means, EXPLAIN is always fast). MySQL 5.6 has made a progress in this regard but its optimizer will still evaluate certain kinds of subqueries (for example, scalar-context subqueries used in range predicates)
