# SSL/TLS Status Variables


The status variables listed on this page relate to encrypting data during transfer with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Often, the term Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is used interchangeably with TLS, although strictly speaking, the SSL protocol is a predecessor to TLS and is no longer considered secure.


For compatibility reasons, the TLS status variables in MariaDB still use the `Ssl_` prefix, but MariaDB only supports its more secure successors. For more information on SSL/TLS in MariaDB, see [Secure Connections Overview](../../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md).


Some of these status values are not under the control of the server, but are reporting back settings of the underlying SSL library used by the server.


## Variables


#### `Ssl_accept_renegotiates`


* Description: Number of negotiations needed to establish the TLS connection. The global value can be flushed by `[FLUSH STATUS](../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush-tables-for-export.md)`.
* Scope: Global
* Data Type: `numeric`



#### `Ssl_accepts`

#### `Ssl_verify_depth`


* Description: TLS verification depth.
How many levels within the certificate signing chain the verification should cover. This is not set by the server itself but by the OpenSSL configuration, and will typically show a very large number like 18446744073709551615, basically meaning "always verify the full signing chain up to the root CA"
* Scope: Global, Session
* Data Type: `numeric`



#### `Ssl_verify_mode`


* Description: TLS verification mode.


The OpenSSL verification mode flags in effect on the server side.


The value so far is always 5 when OpenSSL encryption is in effect, and 0 when not using encryption, or when the server is compiled against WolfSSL.


The value 5 is a combination of the `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` and `SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE` flags, meaning that the client may send a certificate of its own connect, but will not be asked to send one again later for the duration of the encrypted connection.


The `SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT` is not used at this point to enforce that the client sends a certificate if the database user was created with `REQUIRE X509`, `REQUIRE ISSUER` or `REQUIRE SUBJECT`, whether a client certificate was indeed sent, and whether it fits additional `REQUIRE` conditions, is checked by the server itself at a later state.


See also [#notes](https://docs.openssl.org/master/man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify/#notes) for a description of the OpenSSL verify mode flags.


* Scope: Global, Session

* Scope: Global, Session
* Data Type: `string`
