# Security

The use of the CONNECT engine requires the [FILE](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#file) privilege for["outward"](connect-table-types/inward-and-outward-tables.md#outward-tables) tables. This should not be an important restriction. The use of\
CONNECT "outward" tables on a remote server seems of limited interest without\
knowing the files existing on it and must be protected anyway. On the other\
hand, using it on the local client machine is not an issue because it is always\
possible to create locally a user with the `FILE` privilege.
