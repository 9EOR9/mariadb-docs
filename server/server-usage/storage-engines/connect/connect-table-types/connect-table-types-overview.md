CONNECT can handle very many table formats; it is indeed one of its main\
features. The Type option specifies the type and format of the table. The Type\
options available values and their descriptions are listed in the following\
table:

## Catalog Tables

For all table types marked with a '\*' in the table above, CONNECT is able to\
analyze the data source to retrieve the column definition. This can be used to\
define a “catalog” table that display the column description of the source, or\
to create a table without specifying the column definition that are\
automatically constructed by CONNECT when creating the table.

When marked with a ‘$’ the file can be the result returned by a REST query.
