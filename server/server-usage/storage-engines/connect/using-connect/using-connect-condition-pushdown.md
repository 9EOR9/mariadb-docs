# Using CONNECT - Condition Pushdown

{% hint style="warning" %}
This storage engine has been deprecated.
{% endhint %}

The [ODBC](../connect-table-types/connect-odbc-table-type-accessing-tables-from-another-dbms.md), [JDBC](../connect-table-types/connect-jdbc-table-type-accessing-tables-from-another-dbms.md), [MYSQL](../connect-table-types/connect-mysql-table-type-accessing-mysqlmariadb-tables.md), [TBL](../connect-table-types/connect-tbl-table-type-table-list.md) and WMI table types use engine condition pushdown in order to restrict the number of rows returned by the RDBS source or the WMI component.

The CONDITION\_PUSHDOWN argument used in old versions of CONNECT is no longer needed because CONNECT uses condition pushdown unconditionally.
