# InnoDB Recovery Modes

The InnoDB recovery mode is a mode used for recovering from emergency situations. You should ensure you have a backup of your database before making changes in case you need to restore it. The [innodb\_force\_recovery](../innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_force_recovery) server system variable sets the recovery mode. A mode of 0 is normal use, while the higher the mode, the more stringent the restrictions. Higher modes incorporate all limitations of the lower modes.

The recovery mode should never be set to a value other than zero except in an emergency situation.

Please note that recovery mode does not repair corruption. The corrupted files remain corrupted regardless of recovery mode. The sole purpose of recovery mode is to allow read access to the data, if at all possible.

Generally, it is best to start with a recovery mode of 1, and increase in single increments if needs be. With a recovery mode < 4, only corrupted pages should be lost. With 4, secondary indexes could be corrupted. With 5, results could be inconsistent and secondary indexes could be corrupted (even if they were not with 4). A value of 6 leaves pages in an obsolete state, which might cause more corruption.

Until [MariaDB 10.2.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1027-release-notes), mode `0` was the only mode permitting changes to the data. From [MariaDB 10.2.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1027-release-notes), write transactions are permitted with mode `3` or less.

To recover the tables, you can execute [SELECTs](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/select.md) to dump data, and [DROP TABLE](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-table.md) (when write transactions are permitted) to remove corrupted tables.

The following modes are available:

## Recovery Modes

Recovery mode behaviour differs between versions (`server/storage/innobase/include/srv0srv.h`).

It does so by making redo log based recovery ignore certain errors, such as missing data files or corrupted data pages. Any redo log for affected files or pages will be skipped. You can facilitate dumping tables by getting the SELECT \* FROM table\_name statement to jump over corrupt indexes and pages. |

Will also prevent some undo-generating background tasks from running. These tasks could hit a lock wait due to the recovered incomplete transactions whose rollback is being prevented.                                                                    |

Any DDL log for InnoDB tables will be essentially ignored by InnoDB, but the server will start up                                                                                                                                                         |

This behaviour can be changed - see the [innodb\_corrupt\_table\_action](../innodb-system-variables.md) system variable.

## Fixing Things

Try to set innodb\_force\_recovery to 1 and start mariadb. If that fails, try a value of "2". If a value of 2 works, then there is a chance the only corruption you have experienced is within the innodb "undo logs". If that gets mariadb started, you should be able to dump your database with [mariadb-dump](../../../../clients-and-utilities/backup-restore-and-import-clients/mariadb-dump.md). You can verify any other issues with any tables by running [mariadb-check --all-databases](../../../../clients-and-utilities/table-tools/mariadb-check.md).

If you were able to successfully dump your databases, or had previously known good backups, drop your database(s) from the mariadb command line like "[DROP DATABASE](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-database.md) yourdatabase". Stop mariadb. Go to /var/lib/mysql (or whereever your mysql data directory is located) and "rm -i ib\*". Start mariadb, create the database(s) you dropped ("[CREATE DATABASE](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-database.md) yourdatabase"), and then import your most recent dumps: "mysql < mydatabasedump.sql"
