# Schema Changes

## Overview

In MariaDB Enterprise Server, InnoDB supports many different schema change operations. Many of the operations can be performed online with concurrent DML using little or no locking.

## DDL Statements

InnoDB schema changes are performed using the following DDL statements:

* [ALTER TABLE](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md)
* [CREATE INDEX](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-index.md)
* [CREATE SPATIAL INDEX](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-index.md)
* [CREATE UNIQUE INDEX](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-index.md)
* [DROP INDEX](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-index.md)
* [RENAME TABLE](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/rename-table.md)

## About InnoDB Schema Changes and Online DDL

InnoDB schema changes and online DDL are performed with a wide range of statements:

Each operation supports a subset of the following algorithms: `INSTANT, NOCOPY, INPLACE, or COPY`.

By default, InnoDB will use the most efficient algorithm supported by an operation. This behavior can be changed by using the `ALGORITHM` clause with the [ALTER TABLE](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) statement or by changing the value of the alter\_algorithm system variable.

Each operation supports a subset of the following locking strategies: `NONE, SHARED, or EXCLUSIVE`.

By default, InnoDB will use the most permissive locking strategy supported by an operation. This behavior can be changed by using the LOCK clause with the [ALTER TABLE](../../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) statement.
