# Event Limitations

The following restrictions apply to [Events](./).

* All of the restrictions listed in [Stored Routine Limitations](../../stored-routines/stored-routine-limitations.md).
* Events cannot return a resultset.
* Event names are case insensitive, so it's not possible to define two events in the same database if their case insensitive names will match. This restriction has applied since MariaDB/MySQL 5.1.8. If you are upgrading from an older version of MySQL, and have events that could clash, these events need to be renamed before the upgrade.
* Events do not support dates beyond the maximum that can be represented in the Unix epoch (2038-01-19).
* Events cannot be created, dropped or altered by another stored program, trigger or event.
* Events cannot create, drop or alter stored programs or triggers
* Event timings cannot be strictly predicted. The intervals MONTH, YEAR\_MONTH, QUARTER and YEAR are all resolved in months. All others are resolved in seconds. A delay of up to two seconds is possible in extreme cases, and events scheduled to run at the same second cannot be executed in a given order. The `LAST_EXECUTED` column in the `[INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS](../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-events-table.md)` table will however always be accurate to within a second.
* A new connection is used for each execution of statements within the body of an event, so the session counts for [server status variables](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md) such as Com\_delete and Com\_select will not reflect these.
* Because the Event Scheduler depends on grant tables for its functionality, it is automatically disabled when the server is running with [--skip-grant-tables](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-skip-grant-tables).
