# MariaDB Enterprise MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

AI models from providers such as google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are powerful tools for application development. The **MariaDB Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** enhances these capabilities by enabling AI models to interact with external services and execute code directly within your database ecosystem.

The MariaDB Enterprise MCP Server simplifies the creation of modern, data-intensive applications by abstracting backend complexities and offering powerful, out-of-the-box functionalities. While the standard MCP server provides a core set of tools for database interaction, the Enterprise version is specifically designed for large organizations, addressing critical needs for advanced authentication, regulatory compliance, and automated workflows.
