## Quick Start

All API requests require authentication. First, obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=user@example.com&password=your_password"
```

Then include the token in subsequent requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/documents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Base URL

The default base URL for the API is:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

For production deployments, replace with your configured host and port.
