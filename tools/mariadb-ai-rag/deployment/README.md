* System requirements
* Prerequisites
* Security considerations
* Scalability planning

### [Ubuntu Deployment Guide](ubuntu-deployment.md)

Step-by-step guide for deploying on Ubuntu/Debian systems:

* Installing the .deb package
* System configuration
* Service setup
* Database initialization
* Production deployment best practices

### [Docker Deployment Guide](docker-deployment.md)

Complete guide for Docker-based deployments:

* Docker image setup
* Docker Compose configuration
* Container orchestration
* Volume management
* Network configuration
* Multi-container deployments

### [Technical Architecture](technical-architecture.md)

Detailed technical architecture documentation:

* System components and interactions
* Data flow diagrams
* Database schema
* API architecture
* Security architecture
* Performance considerations

### [Deployment Checklist](deployment-checklist.md)

Pre-deployment and post-deployment checklists:

* Pre-deployment verification
* Configuration validation
* Security hardening steps
* Performance optimization
* Monitoring setup
* Backup and recovery planning

## Quick Deployment Paths

### For Development/Testing

1. Use [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) for quick setup
2. Configure minimal settings (database, API keys)
3. Start services with docker-compose
4. Verify with health checks

### For Production

1. Review [Deployment Overview](overview.md) for architecture planning
2. Follow platform-specific guide ([Ubuntu](ubuntu-deployment.md) or [Docker](docker-deployment.md))
3. Complete [Deployment Checklist](deployment-checklist.md)
4. Configure monitoring and backups
5. Review [Technical Architecture](technical-architecture.md) for optimization

## Deployment Best Practices

### Security

* Use strong JWT secrets and API keys
* Enable HTTPS/TLS for production
* Implement network security (firewalls, VPNs)
* Regular security updates
* Secure database credentials

### Performance

* Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
* Configure connection pooling appropriately
* Use SSD storage for database
* Enable caching where appropriate
* Monitor resource usage

### Reliability

* Set up automated backups
* Configure health checks
* Implement logging and monitoring
* Plan for disaster recovery
* Test failover procedures

### Scalability

* Design for horizontal scaling
* Use load balancers for high availability
* Separate database and API servers
* Consider read replicas for database
* Monitor and plan capacity
