# ERD Designer

Created by Stefan Hinz on Sep 19, 2025

Enterprise manager provides a visual interface for creating entity relationship diagrams (ERD) and for observing existing database schemas, so you can quickly understand table relationships, identify dependencies, and visually assess the impact of schema changes before implementation.

The tool is available from the MaxScale GUI.
