# Node and operating system

Created by Egor Ustinov, last modified on Sep 22, 2025

The Node Dashboard provides detailed visibility into the health and performance of individual nodes that run MariaDB Server and MaxScale. It combines uptime, system capacity, operating system details, and hardware utilization with disk and network activity. This view helps administrators ensure each node has sufficient resources and can support the workloads running on it.

***

## Node Information

Provides high-level details about the node, including uptime, role, capacity, and operating system.

***

## Node System Information

Focuses on memory, CPU, load, and process-level resource consumption.

* **Memory Usage** — Percentage of physical memory in use.
* **CPU** — Graph showing CPU usage distribution across user, system, idle, iowait, and kernel categories.
* **Memory Stack** — Detailed breakdown of memory allocation: applications, cache, buffers, swap, kernel slab, page tables, free memory, and corrupted memory.
* **Network Traffic** — Inbound and outbound network throughput per interface.
* **CPU Utilisation** — Effective CPU usage and number of cores reported for the node.
* **System Load** — Load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
* **File Descriptors** — Current number of open file descriptors versus the maximum configured limit.
* **Filesystem Type** — Table listing filesystem types and mount points on the node.

***

## Filesystem Section

Monitors disk performance and utilization for the node’s storage devices.

* **Disk Throughput** — Read and write throughput (bytes per second) per device.
* **Disk IOPS** — Number of input/output operations per second for reads and writes.
* **Disk Utilisation** — Percentage of time that disk devices are busy handling I/O requests.
