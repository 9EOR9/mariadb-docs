# Add multiple MaxScale monitors

MariaDB Enterprise Manager allows you to monitor multiple logical databases or clusters that are managed by the same set of high-availability MaxScale instances. After adding your first MaxScale instance, you can easily add more monitors to track different services without re-entering the connection details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Default Monitor Behavior

If you add a database from a MaxScale setup that has multiple monitors and do not explicitly select one, Enterprise Manager will **automatically assign the first available monitor** by default. To ensure you are tracking the correct service, it's best to specify the monitor manually.
{% endhint %}

## Adding an Additional Monitor
