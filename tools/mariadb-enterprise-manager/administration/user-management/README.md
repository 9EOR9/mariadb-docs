# User Management

MariaDB Enterprise Manager uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions. This guide explains how to manage users and create custom roles to fit your organization's security needs.

### Accessing User Management

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open Settings

Click the **Settings icon (⚙️)** in the left navigation bar.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open User Management

Select **User management**.

## Permissions, Roles & Users

In MariaDB Enterprise Manager, permissions, roles, and users are organized in a clear structure:

* Permissions define specific actions a user can perform (viewing data, editing settings, accessing the SQL editor).
* Roles are collections of one or more permissions grouped together. They can be pre-configured (for example `admin`, `monitoring-admin`, `viewer`) or custom-defined.
* Users are assigned one or more roles and inherit the associated permissions.

This structure allows administrators to manage access by assigning roles to users rather than setting individual permissions per user.

### The Admin Permission

Access to the User Management page is restricted based on a user's assigned permissions.

* ✅ Only users with `admin` permissions (assigned via a role) can add, modify, or remove other users and roles.
*   ❌ Non-admin users cannot access or change these settings, but they can update their own password via their Profile page.\

## Default Roles

Enterprise Manager ships with three pre-configured roles:

* `admin`: Has all permissions. Can do everything, including managing other users.
* `monitoring-admin`: Can manage databases and monitoring, but cannot manage users or roles.
* `viewer`: Has read-only access to monitoring data and can use the Workspace.

**Create custom roles instead of editing pre-configured ones**

While it's possible to edit or delete the pre-configured roles (`admin`, `viewer`, etc.), the recommended best practice is to create a new custom role to fit your specific permission requirements.

Leaving the pre-configured roles unmodified ensures you always have a known, baseline configuration to reference or fall back on.
{% endhint %}

Roles (pre-configured or custom) are built from combinations of the following base permissions:

### Base Permission in MariaDB Enterprise Manager

| Permission | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`    | Can view and manage all users and roles.                                                                                        |
| `edit`     | Can manage databases and monitoring settings. **Requires the `view` permission to be selected as well.**                        |
| `view`     | Can view dashboards and monitoring data.                                                                                        |
| `sql`      | Can access the Query Editor and ERD tools in the Workspace. **Enabling this allows you to set a query row limit for the role.** |

## Managing Roles

Only users with the `admin` permission can create or modify roles.

### Creating a Custom Role

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Roles tab

From the User Management page, select the **Roles** tab.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add role

Click the **Add** button.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Name role

Enter a name for your new role (e.g., "Developer" or "Auditor").
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select base permissions

Select the checkboxes for the **Base Permissions** you want to grant.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Confirm

Click **Add**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you select the `sql` permission, a **"Query editor row limit"** dropdown will appear. You can adjust this value as needed.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When creating a role, selecting the `edit` permission requires you to also select the `view` permission. The system enforces this because a user can't edit something they aren't allowed to see.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Modifying or Deleting a Role

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Locate role

From the **Roles** tab, locate the custom role you wish to change.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open role menu

Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the right side of the role's row.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose action

Select one of the following options:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Update**: Opens the "Edit Role" dialog where you can change the role's name or its assigned permissions.
* **Delete**: Permanently removes the custom role. A confirmation dialog will appear.

{% hint style="info" %}
Roles that are currently assigned to any user cannot be deleted.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% endstepper %}

## The Default Admin User

Upon installation of MariaDB Enterprise Manager, a default `admin` user is created with the password `mariadb`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For security, it is strongly recommended that you change this password immediately after your first login.
{% endhint %}
