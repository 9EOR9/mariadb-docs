# MariaDB MaxScale

This dashboard shows MaxScale’s health and load, how backend servers are seen by each MaxScale, and the traffic/query volume flowing through it—plus cache efficiency from the Query Classifier.

### **Topology Overview**

Provides a visual representation of the entire system's architecture and connectivity.

| **Topology Info**               | Count of nodes grouped by type (e.g., server, MaxScale).                                                                                                                                                |
| **Backend Server States**       | Timeline of each backend server’s role and health as seen by each MaxScale. Values are color-mapped to: Read, Write, Up, Down. Use this to spot failovers, read/write role flips, or outages over time. |
| **Maxscale Uptime by Instance** | Uptime in seconds for each MaxScale instance.                                                                                                                                                           |

### System Metrics

**System Metrics** provide comprehensive insights into the performance and health of individual system resources.

| Metric              | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU Utilisation** | Effective CPU usage (%) per instance, excluding idle/iowait/guest time.                                                          |
| **Memory Usage**    | Working memory in use (%) per instance (total minus free/buffers/cache/slab).                                                    |
| **Network Traffic** | Per-interface throughput (bits/s). Transmit is plotted below the axis (negative-Y), receive above—making direction easy to read. |

### MaxScale Metrics

**Query Classifier Cache Metrics** help in analyzing and optimizing query routing efficiency by tracking cache hits/misses and monitoring cache size.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MaxScale Processing Load | Percentage of total CPU time consumed by the MaxScale process over time (a direct view of router load). |
| Connections              | Active backend connections per server as observed by MaxScale.                                          |
| Operations               | Active operations per backend server (ongoing requests tracked by MaxScale).                            |
| Packets Read/Writes      | Per-server packet read and write rates (packets/s). Useful for spotting uneven load distribution.       |
| QPS                      | Queries per second passing through MaxScale across the selected instances (overall routing throughput). |

### Query Classifier Cache Metrics

Evaluate query routing efficiency by tracking and optimizing cache metrics like hits, misses, and cache size.

| **Cache Hits vs Misses** | Per-second hits and misses in the Query Classifier cache. Analyze the relationship to assess effectiveness. |
| **Cache Size**           | Current size of the Query Classifier cache (bytes). Monitor growth with Hits/Misses for tuning insights.    |
