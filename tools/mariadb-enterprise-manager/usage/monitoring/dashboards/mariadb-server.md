# MariaDB Server

This dashboard provides a unified view of a database topology. It combines topology information, system health, replication or cluster metrics, and query performance in one place. Administrators can use it to monitor availability, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.

## Topology Overview

Summarizes the overall topology, showing which servers are active, their versions, and how they are organized.

* Name — Displays the name of the MariaDB topology currently being monitored.
* Project — Shows the associated project or environment label.
* Primary/Replica — A table with:
  * Instance: Server hostname.
  * Type: Instance role.
  * Seconds behind primary: Replication delay value.
  * Status: Availability of the node.
* Topology Info — Count of nodes grouped by type (e.g., server, MaxScale).
* MariaDB Server Uptime by Instance — Uptime in seconds for each server instance.
