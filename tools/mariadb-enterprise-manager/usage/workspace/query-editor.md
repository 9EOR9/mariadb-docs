# Query Editor

The Query Editor is a powerful, integrated environment for database developers and administrators. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing and debugging SQL and analyzing query results, all from a single interface.

This procedure outlines the steps required to access and utilize the Query Editor within the Workspace section of Enterprise Manager UI.&#x20;

1.  From the main Workspace screen, click the "Run Queries" card.\

## Query Editor Worksheet

The Query Editor Workspace is organized around a flexible, multi-tabbed interface designed for parallel work. At the top level, **Worksheet tabs** represent your connections to different database servers. Within each worksheet, you can open multiple **Query Tabs**, allowing you to write and execute several independent SQL statements without losing your context.

### SQL Code Management Features

These features are designed to make writing and managing SQL code efficient and intuitive.

#### **SQL Editor**

Write, run, and debug SQL statements. The editor supports executing queries in parallel across multiple **Query Tabs**, allowing you to work on different tasks or connect to different servers simultaneously within isolated sessions.

#### **SQL Code Completion**

Speed up query authoring and minimize syntax errors with context-sensitive suggestions. As you type, the editor offers relevant SQL keywords, functions, and objects (like tables and columns) from the currently selected database schema.

#### **SQL Code Formatter**

Improve readability and maintain consistent coding standards by automatically formatting your SQL code. Access this feature via the editor's context menu or command palette (`F1`).

#### **SQL Syntax Highlighting**

Enhance code clarity with color syntax highlighting. Different parts of your SQL statements (keywords, strings, comments) are displayed in distinct colors, making queries easier to scan and debug.

#### **SQL Snippets**

Save frequently used SQL code blocks for quick reuse across sessions. Press `CTRL+D` (or `CMD+D` on Mac) to save the current content of the editor as a snippet.

#### **SQL History**

Keep track of every query executed within the Workspace. The **History** tab provides a running log, allowing you to quickly find, review, and re-execute previous commands.

#### **Multiple Connections**

Define and manage connections to various database servers (e.g., development, testing, production). Each connection opens in its own top-level **Worksheet tab**, within which you can open multiple **Query Tabs**.

#### **Open/Edit/Save SQL Files**

Load existing SQL scripts from your local machine into the editor, make changes, and save them back without leaving the workspace.

### Data Management and Analysis Features

These features help you interact with and understand the results of your queries.

#### **Export Result Sets**

Easily share or archive query results. You can export data grids directly into common formats like `CSV`, `JSON`, or as `SQL INSERT` statements.

#### **Display multiple Result Sets**

When executing a script with multiple `SELECT` statements, view each result set in its own dedicated grid within the Results panel for easy comparison.

#### **Vertical Results Mode**

Improve readability for tables with many columns by displaying results in a vertical, record-by-record format.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Result Set Limits**

Control the number of rows returned by `SELECT` statements (default: 10,000). This safety feature keeps queries responsive and can be adjusted per role.

#### **Result Visualizations**

Gain quick insights from your data by visualizing query results directly within the Workspace as simple **line, bar, or scatter charts**.

#### **Grid Operations**

Interact directly with the data displayed in the Results grid. Perform actions like **searching** for specific values, **filtering** rows, **grouping** data, and customizing column visibility without writing additional SQL.
