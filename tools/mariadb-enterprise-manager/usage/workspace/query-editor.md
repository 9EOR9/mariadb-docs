# Query Editor

Created by Stefan Hinz on Sep 19, 2025

Enterprise Manager contains a SQL query editing tool that helps write, test, debug, and optimize SQL queries without switching different applications.

The tool is available from the [MaxScale GUI](https://app.gitbook.com/s/0pSbu5DcMSW4KwAkUcmX/mariadb-maxscale-tutorials/using-maxgui#run-queries).
