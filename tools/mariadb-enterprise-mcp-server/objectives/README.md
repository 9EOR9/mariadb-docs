# Objectives

The primary goal of the MariaDB Enterprise MCP Server is to enable the secure and scalable deployment of AI agents within enterprise environments.

Key objectives include:

* **Enhance Security and Compliance**: Integrate with centralized secret management platforms like HashiCorp Vault and 1Password to eliminate static credentials and meet stringent enterprise security policies.
* **Streamline Complex AI Workflows**: Provide a unified endpoint for orchestrating multi-step RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, from data ingestion to final response generation.
* **Improve Manageability**: Offer a robust, configurable, and observable server that can be reliably deployed and managed by platform engineering and DBA teams.
* **Accelerate AI Application Development**: Provide a standardized protocol that simplifies how developers connect AI agents to MariaDB data.
