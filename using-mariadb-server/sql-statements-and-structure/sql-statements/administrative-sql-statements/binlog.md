### Description <a href="#description" id="description"></a>

`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the [mariadb-binlog](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-binlog/) program as the printable representation of certain events in [binary log](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/binary-log/) files. The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded string that the server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the corresponding event. This statement requires the [SUPER](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/grant/#super) privilege (<= [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1051-release-notes/)) or the [BINLOG REPLAY](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/grant/#binlog-replay) privilege (>= [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1052-release-notes/)).
